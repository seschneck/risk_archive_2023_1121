We have a mental health crisis in the U.S. and it is a crisis of unmet high need because our delivery of mental healthcare is deeply flawed. In 2019, more than half of the 52 million Americans with an active mental illness did not receive any treatment. More than half!

[PAUSE] 

And for the 20 million adults suffering with a substance use disorder, it was worse still; 9 out of 10 without any treatment

Our failure to treat is even more troubling for vulnerable groups.  Black and LatinX adults receive mental healthcare services at only half the rate of whites.  

And similar mental healthcare disparities exist for people living in rural communities and for those with lower incomes.

- Failure to treat is not surprising given many treatment barriers:
  - Access
  - Availability
  - Affordability
  - Acceptability
:::  

::: {.notes}
Our failure to treat is, unfortunately, not surprising.  There are many well known barriers to receiving traditional mental healthcare.

These include problems with access that are particularly limiting for people living in rural communities

Problems with availability

Treatment costs are often prohibitive for those without health insurance 

and stigma and related issues make traditional treatments for mental illness less acceptable to some patients.

## Digital Therapeutics (DTx)

Digital therapeutics are smartphone "apps" that are designed to prevent, manage, or treat disease, including mental illness. 


Can augment mental health services to address barriers

- Accessible everywhere
- Available 24/7
- Highly scalable (affordable?)

::: {.notes}
Fortunately, digital therapeutics are now being developed and used by patients to address many of these treatment barriers.

These digital therapeutics can be combined with traditional treatments to reduce barriers because they are

-Accessible everywhere
-Available everyday, 24/7
-and highlighly scalable, which may lower costs

<!--Need to make above points gray-->


::: {.notes}
Of course, these benefits would be meaningless if digital therapeutics were not effective.

But they are.  

For example, patients with substance use disorders who use a digital therapeutic have almost double the odds of being abstinent from alcohol or other drugs

These increases in abstinence from using digital therapeutics are observed not only when compared to patients on wait lists, who have yet to gain access to treatment but also when digital therapeutics are added on top of traditional treatments for substance use disorders.

And these benefits are durable - they have been documented up to 12 months after the start of treatment.

<!--need to insert full screen of the beta app image from stock photos-->

::: {.notes}
These apps are in use today with patients with SUD and at least two have recently received FDA approval.  However, I think they are still best considered beta versions relative to their full potential. 

Their power comes from easy, 24/7 access to their many supports - the treatments, tools, and services built into these smartphone apps. But this is also their Achilles heel. As the patient using these apps, you now have to tackle difficult questions like:
- When should I use them?
- For how long?
- Which of their many supports are best for me?
- And which are best for me **right now**, at this moment in time?

## Smart Digital Therapeutics

<!--make this a quote and highlight key works in red-->


> “Could you predict not only [who]{style="color: red;"} might be at greatest risk for relapse … <br>
 … but precisely [when]{style="color: red;"} that relapse might occur … <br>
 … and how [best to intervene]{style="color: red;"} to prevent it?"

::: {.notes}
My research team became interested in these issues when my colleague Dave Gustafson, the developer of a leading digital therapeutic for substance use disorders, approached us with a simple question. He asked...

"Could you predict not only who might be at greatest risk for relapse
but precisely when that relapse might occur and
how best to intervene to prevent it"

Dave had just completed a large study demonstrating the effectiveness of his app. However, he also noticed many of the people who relapsed hadn't used the app in the days leading up to that relapse. 

And others who had relapsed hadn't used the specific supports in the app that he would have thought would be most effective for them.

The next wave of digital therapeutics, lets call them smart digital therapeutics, must learn to know us well enough to recognize when we are at greatest risk for relapse and they must be smart enough to recommend the specific supports that would be most effective for us at that moment in time to prevent that relapse. And these apps will do this through the use of built-in artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms that are powered by personal sensing.

## Lapse Prediction in Patients with Alcohol Use Disorder

![Picture1.png](Picture1.png){.absolute top="20%" right="0%" width="400px" height="auto"}\    

- 151 patients with AUD
- Early in recovery (1-8 weeks)
- Committed to abstinence throughout study period
- Followed for up to 3 months
- Collected active and passive personal sensing data streams

GOAL: Develop a temporally precise lapse monitoring (prediction) system for patients with AUD

<!--add people images and NIAAA image JOHN I inserted a sample image above that is placed to float near the bullets. -->

::: {.notes}
So let me transition now to describing how we are taking the first baby steps toward developing smart digital therapeutics for SUD

We have recently completed a NIAAA funded project where we collected data from 151 participants who were in early recovery from a moderate to severe alcohol use disorder.  

These participants were committed to abstinence at the start of the study and we followed them for up to 3 months, collecting a variety of active and passive personal sensing data streams.

Our first goal with this grant was to develop machine learning algorithms that can generate temporally precise predictions about when future lapses back to alcohol use will occur for patients with AUD.

:::

## Personal Sensing Data Streams

<!--EMA in red-->
- 4X daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA)

- Monthly self-report

- Geolocation (GPS)

- Cellular communications (voice and text messages)
  - Meta data
  - Text message content

- Sleep sensor (Wake/sleep times; sleep efficiency; wakings; restlessness)

::: {.notes}
As I mentioned, in this project, we collected a variety of active and passive personal sensing data streams.   

Participants completed brief (7-10 item) ecological momentary assessments or EMAs, 4 times per day

We also have 
- more temporally coarse, monthly self reports, 
- Moment by moment geolocation,
- Meta data from their cellular communications and the actual content of their text messages, 
- and we had sleep sensors in their beds.

We are in the early stages of model building at this point and I will focus today on results from models using only EMA.  However, we are actively working with GPS and I’ll end with some brief discussion of those preliminary models as well

:::

## 4x Daily Ecological Momentary Assessments

<!-- Reproduce slide 11-->


::: {.notes}
So let me tell you a bit more about the 4x daily EMA we collected.  

On each EMA, participants reported the date and time of any lapses back to alcohol use that they hadn’t previously reported. 

All of the EMAs also asked them about their current craving, affective valence and arousal, recent risky situations, and recent stressful and pleasant events since their last EMA.

On the first EMA each day, they also reported any future risky situations and stressful events that they expected in the next week and their confidence that they would remain abstinent. 
:::

## Feature Engineering


- Features based on recent past experiences (12, 24, 48, 72, 168 hours)

- Min, max, and median response (all items)

- History (count) of past lapses (item 1) and completed EMAs (compliance)

- Raw scores and change scores (from baseline/all past responses)

::: {.notes}
We used these raw EMAs to engineer about 300 features to use in machine learning models to predict future lapses

We formed features by aggregating EMA items over various past time periods ranging from 12 -168 hours in the past

We calculated mins, maxes and medians for the EMA items in these time periods

We also calculated counts of past lapses and counts of past EMAs completed to index compliance

And we included these scores both in raw form and as change from baselines for the participant based on all their previous responses since the start of the study.
:::

## Machine Learning Methods


- Predict hour-by-hour probability of future lapse

- Lapse window widths
  - 1 hour
  - 1 day
  - 1 week

::: {.notes}

For our purposes today I wont dive deep into the machine learning methods but let me highlight a few high level details 

We used these features I just described to make predictions about the hour-by-hour probability of a future lapse.  We are developing separate models for three future lapse windows – lapses in the next hour, lapses in the next day, and lapses in the next week.  

For example, if I was in recovery from an AUD, I could use these models to generate the probability that I would lapse after this symposium starting at 4pm.  One model would generate the probability of a lapse between 4pm and 5 pm today, the second would predict the probability of a lapse between 4 pm today and 4pm tomorrow and the third would provide the probability of a lapse between 4 pm today and 4pm next Tuesday.  

And of course, all of the models would only use data collected prior to 4 pm today so that they are “predicting”, in the full sense of the word, into the future and not just demonstrating an association.

:::

## Machine Learning Methods

- Statistical Algorithms
  - ElasticNet GLM (e.g., LASSO, ridge regression)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - KNN

- Model Tuning and Performance Evaluation
  - Area under ROC curve (AUC) as primary performance metric
  - Sensitivity, Specificity, Balanced accuracy, Positive predictive value

::: {.notes}
We are evaluating machine learning model configurations that differ by common statistical algorithms. 

We are evaluating these models primarily using the area under the ROC curve but we also consider and report a variety of other common metrics.

And, of course, these performance metrics are calculated for new observations and new participants that the models have never seen and were not trained on by using grouped 10-fold cross-validation.
