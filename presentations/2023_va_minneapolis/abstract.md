Title: Smart Digital Therapeutics for Alcohol Use Disorder: Algorithms for Prediction and Adaptive Intervention


Abstract: Personal sensing may enhance the engagement and effectiveness of digital therapeutics for substance use disorders.  In particular, moment-by-moment sensing of relapse risk can be used to both engage the patient and to adapt and time the delivery of messaging, interventions and support from the digital therapeutic.  

First, we describe methods for active and passive sensing during early recovery from alcohol use disorder.  Next, we present results from a study designed to develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict lapses back to alcohol use among patients in recovery from alcohol use disorder.  Following this, we discuss plans to use this model to provide daily, algorithm-guided recommendations to personalize and adapt digital therapeutic use for patients with AUD.
