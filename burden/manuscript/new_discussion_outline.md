1. Individuals with SUD will accept personal sensing methods
	* consent, enroll, opt-in at high rates
	* Even true for sensitve/private info like geolocation and celluar communications
	* Room for improvements in perceptions for all methods.   Some did it but didnt "like" it.
	
2.  Individuals can sustain personal sensing for relatively long periods
	* Good compliance generally for three months
	* Relative low attrition for three months
	* self report on use for up to one year
	* Three months still not long enough.  Need research on longer use within clinical applications

3. Some types of active personal sensing are acceptable and sustainable
	* Small or non-sig differences between active and passive sensing methods overall
	* Positive self report for EMA
	* Good compliance for EMA for three months
	* Maybe better still if 1x 
		* Compiance better for 1 x
		* self report on 1x?
		
4. Other types of active sensing may be acceptable to fewer people.  [Likely best as short separate section rather than combined with section 3]
	* Combo of active, sensitive, and difficult to do privately
	* Will handle love/hate differences in section on consistency/individual differences
	
5. Perceptions are only moderately consistent across specific methods
	* ICCs
	* Free response about daily check in.  Some hate, some love.
	* Raise options for opt-in algorithms
	
6.  Benefits likely matter
	* Benefits not formally accessed in our study
	* Monetary incentives may have helped in our study.
		* They were small
		* May still be impactful with low SES groups?
	* Incentives can be used in clinical applications
	* Clinical benefits may help in clinical applications
	
7.  Trust likely matters
	* Research studies well positioned for trust (describe protections, etc)
	* Free responses
	* Established literature
	* Not same for everyone
		* SUD
		* other marginalized groups
		
9.  Feasibility is function of more than participant perceptions
	* cost/accessibility - smartphone is better than wearables
	* Churn
