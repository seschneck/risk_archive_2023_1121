What will the app track
• The app will track users -
    ◦ GPS location
    ◦ phone call logs (e.g., phone number, saved contact information, duration of call) 
    ◦ SMS text message logs (e.g., phone number, saved contact information)
    ◦ SMS text message content (only the text of the message, NEVER images sent or received)
    ◦ completion of study tasks
    ◦ app use (e.g., use of recovery resources or other app features)
What consequences will exist if the patient relapses (e.g., will their clinician be told, will the police be told, etc.)
• Having a slip will not affect participant payment or participation. Reports of slips and all other information collected in this study will be protected by our Certificate of Confidentiality. We will never share information about a participant's lapse with any outside individuals or organisations. 
Payment – what does the payment structure look like in a general sense? How much can they earn?
• You can earn payment and bonuses by completing study tasks and meeting target goals.
• Specifically:
    ◦ $10 per month for submitting the monthly update
    ◦ About $15 per month for submitting daily updates. You will earn about $0.25 per survey plus bonuses for completing at least 12 surveys in each half of the month.
    ◦ About $10 per month for daily video check ins (i.e., submitting a video). You will earn about $0.17 per video plus bonuses for at least 12 in each half of the month.
