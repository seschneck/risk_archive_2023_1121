macro:->Participants
provided
ratings
of
dislike
and
willingness
separately
for
text
message
and
phone
call
logs.
However,
participants'
ratings
for
each
item
were
highly
correlated
across
the
two
logs
(r
=
0.83
for
dislike;
r
=
0.79
for
willingness).
Furthermore,
permissions
for
API
access
to
text
messages
and
phone
call
logs
are
linked
for
both
Android
and
iOS
operating
systems
such
that
researchers
and
app
developers
get
access
to
both
if
permission
is
granted.
Therefore,
we
decided
to
combine
ratings
of
dislike
and
willingness
for
each
of
these
two
logs.

did

so
the
comparisons

categories
were
limited

and

use
for

Also,
due
to
high
proportion

we
excluded
