# Topics to Discuss (not ordered meaningfully yet)


## Population studied


* Moderate to severe AUD
* Unstable (drop-out/attrition expected)
* AUD is highly stigmatized
* But still not illegal behavior RE OUD
* Sample not racially/ethnically diverse.  Trust might be lower still in groups that experience systemic racism


## Consent and enrollment behaviors

* All but one consent yet 169/192 enroll (88%)
* Provide lower and upper limits of willingness to share these data?
* Expect to lose some between consent and enrollment given the instability of early recovery
* Expect that some might consent but not return to enroll b/c less assertive about their concerns or reconsider on discussion with others.  But see explanations in table for attrition.  Some seem not to be concerned but just more unstable.
* 100% of those that enroll opt in. (need to discuss incentives as above)
* Main concerns might be sensitivity rather than burden in these measures

## Later drop out

* Mostly for reasons other than burden
* But some burden or uncertain/unknown reasons

## Compliance for active measures

* relatively high for EMA (77%) even though 4x daily for 90 days
* Higher still if only needed 1x per day (94%)
* Discuss hypothetical about 1x per day, the caveat hypothetical?
* NOTE: Were there time effects for EMA by week?
* much lower for Audio (53%)
* Audio required more privacy (sensitivity and burden)
* What about models built with user preferences for data shared (goes here or based on ICCS?)


## Self report

* All mean self report questions for all methods significantly more acceptable than neutral
* But, what about non-trivial percentages below neutral?
* ICCS for perceptions display moderate consistency
	* suggest some general attitudes and some method specific issues
* Active effort
	* Didnt dislike active more but less willing to use for a year
	* Some methods will always be active (EMA) but others might get more passive (sleep, physiology)


## Acceptability is only part of the puzzle

* which are useful predictors?
* Which can be obtained stably over time?
* Smartphone vs. others (wearable?) sensors
* Cost and access to sensors
* Churn or early development stage
	* Beddit
	* Moves
	* Empatica


## Framework for making decisions to use

* Costs, benefits and trust
* Sensitivity (not assessed).  May differ by content and by population?
* Burden
* Benefits (monetary incentives, clinical benefits)
* Who gets data -self, providers matters?

## Ethical issues?

* Who gets the data and what do they do with it
* Business model matters


## Role of incentives

* EMA incentives are recommended as effective in  research
* Small monetary incentive but opt-in for all sensing in our study
* No clinical treatment benefits in research
* Clinical implementation would provide valuable support?


## Next steps?
