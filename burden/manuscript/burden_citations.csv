Stone,2003,Intensive momentary reporting of pain with an electronic diary,empirical,Pain,active,yes,91,clinical - chronic pain sufferers (diagnosed with 1 of 4 pain conditions),2 weeks,"0, 3, 6, or 12",94% compliance; compliance not affected by sampling density,,,,6 questions after 2 weeks (scale 0/not at all - 3/extremely) - 3 questions of main interest (How willing would you be to participate in a study like this again; How much of a burden was it to particpate in this study over the last week; How much did participating in this study interefere with your usual activities),"Small but significant differences - As the intensity of the momentary protocol increased, so did perceived burden of the study. Similarly, greater interference with daily activities was reported in the more intensive protocols. However, willingness to participate in another momentary study was not related to sampling density in an orderly fashion. Overall, we conclude that completing diaries throughout the day was not viewed as an unpleasant or overly burdensome task.",
