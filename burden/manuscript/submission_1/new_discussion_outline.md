1. Individuals with SUD will accept personal sensing methods
	* consent, enroll, opt-in at high rates
	* Even true for sensitve/private info like geolocation and celluar communications
	* Room for improvements in perceptions for all methods.   Some did it but didnt "like" it. <!--Maybe "did it but didnt like it might be better in the trust or costs/benefits sections>
	
2.  Individuals can sustain personal sensing for relatively long periods
	* Good compliance generally for three months
	* Relative low attrition for three months
	* self report on use for up to one year
	* Three months still not long enough.  Need research on longer use within clinical applications
	* Tie back to chronic disease model to make point that the need for monitoring will be very long-term.

3. Some types of active personal sensing are acceptable and sustainable
	* Small or non-sig differences between active and passive sensing methods overall
	* Positive self report for EMA
	* Good compliance for EMA for three months
	* Maybe better still if 1x 
		* Compliance better for 1 x
		* self report on 1x? (with explicit caveats)
	* Highlight that this is good because active EMA can provide valuable insights not available by other methods.
	
4. Perceptions are only moderately consistent across specific methods and within categories of active/passive
	* ICCs
	* Free response about daily check in.  Some hate, some love.  Some do it well, some not at all.
	* Raise options for opt-in algorithms
	
5.  Benefits likely matter
	* Benefits not formally accessed in our study
	* Monetary incentives may have helped in our study.
		* They were small
		* May still be impactful with low SES groups?
		* May have done even though not acceptable b/c of incentives.
	* Incentives can be used in clinical applications
	* Clinical benefits may help in clinical applications
	
6.  Trust likely matters
	* Research studies well positioned for trust (describe protections, etc)
	* Free responses
	* Established literature
	* Not same for everyone
		* SUD;  Our sample was willing to report illegal drug use as well as alcohol use
		* other marginalized groups
		* not well represented in our study
		* actions that need to be implemented
		
7.  Feasibility is function of more than participant perceptions
	* cost/accessibility - smartphone is better than wearables
	* Churn
