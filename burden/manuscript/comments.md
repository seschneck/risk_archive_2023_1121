1. **Individuals with SUD will accept personal sensing methods**
	* consent, enroll, opt-in at high rates
	* Even true for sensitve/private info like geolocation and celluar communications
	* Room for improvements in perceptions for all methods.   Some did it but didnt "like" it. <!--Maybe "did it but didnt like it might be better in the trust or costs/benefits sections>

	Comments [Positive about geolocation and communications]:  
	- "Location tracking is fun and useful for me personally in addition to the study."
	- "It was Interesting to see my patterns and places."
	- "No issues, like that they allow me to delete some items from the log if I wanted to."
	- "Having the opportunity to delete texts was nice even though I hardly ever did."
	- "I have no issues at all with tracking my calls."

	
	Also tons of comments from geolocation about not even thinking about this method/having no issues with it because it was so passive.   
	- "It doesn't matter. I didn't know what was happening with the location app. It was doing on its own."
	- "I forgot this was even happening most of the time. It did not interfere with my life."
	- "Never even thought about it."
	- "I never could tell I was being tracked."
	- "I forgot I was being tracked so it was not a big deal to me."

	A few from communications too (here are some examples):
	- "I went about my days as i normally would and never thought about it."
	- "Never noticed so it was zero inconvenience whatsoever !"
	- "It was easy and staff was doing everything."
	
	
2.  **Individuals can sustain personal sensing for relatively long periods**
	* Good compliance generally for three months
	* Relative low attrition for three months
	* self report on use for up to one year
	* Three months still not long enough.  Need research on longer use within clinical applications
	* Tie back to chronic disease model to make point that the need for monitoring will be very long-term.

	Possible comments [some from next section below might also be applicable]:   
	- "My surveys ended a couple of days ago. I miss being reminded to check my emotional state."
	- "Wo agree to extend a year no problem." --> about communications (assuming Wo is typo for would)
	- "I had no problem with this but would like to opt out when I am done with the study."
	- "I suppose for a year study I would be concerned about misuse of data."

3. **Some types of active personal sensing are acceptable and sustainable**
	* Small or non-sig differences between active and passive sensing methods overall
	* Positive self report for EMA
	* Good compliance for EMA for three months
	* Maybe better still if 1x 
		* Compliance better for 1 x
		* self report on 1x? (with explicit caveats)
	* Highlight that this is good because active EMA can provide valuable insights not available by other methods.
    
    
    Note: This point says acceptable and sustainable - seems to overlap with point 2?    
    
	Comments [not sure these all go in this section]:   
	- "They were quick and easy to complete."
	- "The surveys were not a hassle and they helped me become more in tune with my feelings. It's nice to have an hour to complete the surveys in cases when they send at inconvenient times."
	- "I felt it was an annoyance, another thing i had to do on top of everything else when it was so frequent. I found one per day is tolerable by days end not a set time. I am just too scattered with how my brain works."
	- "The survey was great for the first three months as i worked on what and how i was feeling and attempted to increase how mindful i was of my feelings. Fourth month i found myself trying to detach more from my phone and stay in the moment so it was harder to complete."
	- "The home surveys were easy to complete but I would have inserted different questions to vary the routine."
	- "One daily would be great."
	- "It was a good tool to help me reflect. However, when i was busy or travelling it felt a bit more like a chore. Especially during the last weeks."
	- "I liked the structure that it added to my day. For other activities,a being deliberate about setting aside time for things has helped me maintain changes to my life for the better. The surveys were no exception."
	- "I had no issues for the daily surveys. I felt that it kept me in check and reminder to not drink. I would not change it."
	- "I didn't mind doing the surveys, as long as I had Internet there were no burdens related to getting them completed."
	- "Great tool for self check in. Not necessary to do four per day."
	- "They were fine just sometimes bad timing."
	- "They didn't interfere, but sometimes they would be sent at times when I was busy."
	- "Surveys were great. I had gotten so used to them coming that i miss them now that they are no longer coming!!"
	- "It was fine with me I'm just ready to move on."
	- "I would be willing to extend the survey."
	- "I didnt mind the surveys but after the second month i felt like they became repetitive and I didn't feel like I got much utility from them."
	- "I didn't mind the process too much, but as time went on, I payed less attention to giving thoughtful answers each time."
	- "They could have come more spread out throughout the day. The second one usually came within an hour of the first one. The third was usually during work hours as well."
	- "The four interruptions are rather a pain. I have wanted to yell -well NO i had not thought about drinking but now that YOU mentioned it I want a drink!!"
	- "Surveys a bit intrusive. One or two less surveys a day would be ideal."
	- "Seemed like a lot when in was busy with kids and family stuff. I probably answered out of habit more than what was true in that moment."
	- "Once i began drinking i had an aversion to the surveys."
	- "I did well with my recovery on my own and the surveys were more of a burden at the end. Maybe base the number of surveys on each individual's recovery progress."
	- "Completing the surveys four times a day did become boring and repetitive some days.  I didn’t feel like my mood or thoughts changed much over the course of a single day."
	- "Became overwhelming over time."
	
4. **Perceptions are only moderately consistent across specific methods and within categories of active/passive**
	* ICCs
	* Free response about daily check in.  Some hate, some love.  Some do it well, some not at all.
	* Raise options for opt-in algorithms

	Comments [loved audio check-in] --> some of these suggest clinical benefit of doing audio survey:  
	- "This was my favorite part of the study. It helped me to set a good intention towards my recovery."
	- "This question helps me understand where I stand in my recovery and serves as a reminder for abstinence."
	- "It made me pause for a second and really think about how my day was."
    - "It was good to think about how i was feeling each day, but also became a bit of a to do."
    - "It helped me realize my emotions and I had something to answer to which helped keep me on track."
    - "It helped me be mindfull."
    - "I loved this part! It was like journaling kind of where i would discover things that were hidden in my subconscious. I have a recording app on my phone and i will continue doing the voice check in as a form of checking in with myself."
    - "I liked the daily check omw [sp] it gave me a way to vent without being judged."

    Comments [modality of audio check-in]:  
	- "Nice to speak rather than type through the check in."
	- "I liked knowing someone would actually be listening to me and my voice and not just the survey questions."
	- "I enjoyed the daily check more than all the other surveys. To be able to verbilize my feelings was the most best therapy. You should expand on this and have more verbal check-ins."
	- "I would have much preferred to type the message."
	- "I did not do this part. I am not a fan of talking on/to a phone."
	- "I am not much of a phone talker so I sometimes found it difficult to find words."

    Comments [privacy issues related to audio check-in]:   
	- "The only negative part about the daily check in was my mom, who I live and work with, listening in while I was talking. I would have to find a time when she was preoccupied or away from me to talk freely. Other than that I found it very helpful to reflect on how my day was in general when it came to my urges and cravings."
	- "It was often difficult to find privacy to respond."
	- "This one was harder to like because I felt like I needed privacy to complete it, which sometimes I don't have."
	- "Sometimes I wouldn't be able to do it because I was with people too much which was frustrating."
	- "Oftentimes found myself in public places. Hard to record and if I did it was hard to open up."
	- "The audio portion was terrible. It takes time out of your day where you have to completely switch locations just so you can do t in private. I don't like that people could hear me and the topic wherever and whenever so I stopped using it."
	- "I also have to keep privacy in mind since it's not something I'd like to complete within earshot of others."
	- "Audio surveys were uncomfortable especially if there was no privacy to do them."

    Comments [open-ended prompt]:    
	- "I liked that they were open ended."
	- "This part was a little repetitive but I found it mostly fine to do."
	- "I would prefer if the prompt changed over time. Recovery prompt was vague and old after the 4 months."
	- "Would prefer a specific questions ion to answer or comment on."
	- "I often couldn't think of anything to say so I would have found a less open-ended prompt useful."
	- "Still hated these. Perhaps i would have liked it better if I had prompts to respond to."
	- "If i was more of a diary type of person I'd probably be more into this kind of thing. Again no strong feelings i mostly just didn't know what to say."
	- "This was the most difficult part of the study for me.  I eventually just stopped completing the audio journal because I just didn't have anything to say."
	- "Generally disliked the open ended nature of these. Maybe provide a rotating prompt?"

    Comments [related to opt-in algorithms?]:    
	- "It would be nice if it were an option. For example if I had something that was weighing on my mind or a new trigger event."
	- "The daily checkins become more difficult to complete as time went on." --> This may go in section 3?
	- "Got to be a burden as the study progressed." --> may go in section 3?
	- "I liked the fact I could shut it off if I wanted to" --> about geolocation

	
	Also tons of comments about forgetting to do them as a reason for possibly low compliance. --> this prob wouldn't go in this section though?
	
5.  **Benefits likely matter**
	* Benefits not formally accessed in our study
	* Monetary incentives may have helped in our study.
		* They were small
		* May still be impactful with low SES groups?
		* May have done even though not acceptable b/c of incentives.
	* Incentives can be used in clinical applications
	* Clinical benefits may help in clinical applications

	Comments:    
    - "Was okay to have done in the context of the study or for an app that would help me stay sober." --> May also fit in trust section?  
    - "If it helps me then I would do it."
    - "Don't mind if I can stay sober."
    - "I'm a somewhat typical introverted, slightly paranoid, grump, so the idea of being tracked is automatically negative. That being said, if it's something that helps people that can be a really good thing."
    - "At times it [EMA] was inconvenient but if it helps with recovery its worth it."
    - "Only for the sake of my recovery."
    - "Loss of privacy for the sake of sorberity, okay I'll give in."
    - "It is a huge invasion but my sobriety is paramount to my overall health."
    - "If you're serious about recovery, some privacy is to be sacrificed."
    - "If it helps recovery, fine with me!"
    - "If i felt desperate in my recovery i would probably agree and appreciate that long term but i don't think it was necessary for me."
    - "It seems this was more to aid with the study research than to help with my recovery. If i could see a way it would be prioritized to help me, i would be more willing to have them tracked longer. Because of the way its use was communicated to me, it didn't seem to improve accountability."
    - "I wouldn't let my text message contents be tracked if i hadn't been paid"

    Comments that may suggest some clinical benefit from our sensing methods:  
    - "It honestly stopped me from going places I know may be a trigger." 
    - "I thought it was kind of fun when i went someplace different and i would think of you guys helping me to stay sober."
    - "Helps my recovery and keeping me accountable."
    - "When experiencing depressive thoughts, taking the survey drew attention to those feelings. When doing the survey, it's a moment to take stock of feelings (aroused/alert vs. calm/sleepy) and successes or failures with maintaining abstinence. Definitely impacted my mood overall. Especially the audio surveys."
    - "It helped me keep me honest by reminding me that i can't have alcohol. Four reminders per day to abstain."
	- "I think knowing i had the surveys to answer positively reinforced my decision to not drink."
    
    Tons of more comments about helpfulness of EMA surveys to peoples recovery. Also, comments in point 4 for audio check-in may suggest clinical benefit.   
	
6.  **Trust likely matters**
	* Research studies well positioned for trust (describe protections, etc)
	* Free responses
	* Established literature
	* Not same for everyone
		* SUD;  Our sample was willing to report illegal drug use as well as alcohol use
		* other marginalized groups
		* not well represented in our study
		* actions that need to be implemented

	
	Comments [about trust]:   
	- "I trusted the study group to not use my personal information for any other use."  
    - "My only concern for privacy would be if the software was not secure and others not part of study staff could follow me." 
    - "It was made clear to me from the beginning that I wouldn’t be judged or punished for failing to stay sober, so I was comfortable being honest."
    - "Invasive in theory, no problems actually because of confidentality."
    - "I don't mind turning this info over and I trust the people running the study."
    - "I don't mind this at all either, as long as I know this information is protected and anonymous."
    - "Didn't bother me since its protected."
    - "As long as my personal information was secure and only shared by study staff, and its collection could help in my recovery, I'm comfortable with it."
    - "As long as it stayed strictly confidential."
    - "Just in general this feels intrusive but as part of the study it is fine!"
    - "I have a lot of conversations that I don't feel comfortable sharing with the staff. The call logs are not a big deal for me to be tracked but I feel as though access to text content can be intrusive."

	
	Other related comments contextualized in real-life/society:    
	- "That didn't bother me. I feel like so much is tracked nowadays via our phones."
	- "Feel weird about it because of today's times in our government. Just saying, feel like liberties are stripped away a lot so hard to trust anyone."
	- "I am concerned with data privacy, and felt uncomfortable having my location actively tracked."
	- "I would never allow this in real life."  
	

	Could also mention something about transparancy to improve trust. Our study was very transparent through informed consent about what we would be doing with/how we would be handling their data. We may have been less transparent though about how their data is related to lapse risk (since we didn't have any algorithms built yet to go off of). See comments below for mixture of reactions.   
	
    Comments:    
    - "I don’t mind being tracked since I appreciate the purpose of it."
    - "I am interested to see how this data helps future addicts recover."
    - "I can see how this could help some people, but I don't go to bars/clubs/etc. I don't see this helping me, personally."
    - "I don't really see much of a correlation with completing these surveys and staying sober."
    - "Didn't mind after I asked more about it."
    - "It was fine, but my messages are pretty irrelevant to my recovery."
    - "Never really understood what the study was going after with my log."
    - "Undecided here not because the data is useless, but I struggle to see how, at least for me, it would be useful."
    - "It’s a pretty personal thing but I understand the reasoning behind that."
		
7.  **Feasibility is function of more than participant perceptions**
	* cost/accessibility - smartphone is better than wearables
	* Churn 
	* Other tech issues that may cause frustration among participants
	
	Comments [audio check-in]:   
	- "Unfortunately my phone often cut me off at 10 seconds so that was frustrating."
	- "The only thing I don't like is how the up one easily stops recording you if your finger comes off the record button for a micro second."
	- "The audio app rarely worked with my phone."
	- "Technical difficulties with my phone made it hard to do those for a little while. Perhaps recommend deleting the message after sending to free up space?"
	- "Sometimes had trouble sending files."
	- "I experienced issues with this from the very beginning and discontinued early on. I was unable to get the message beyond 8-10 seconds with close to 6 attempts each day. Was not worth the time or stress for me."

	Comments [geolocation]:
	- "My bigger problem with the tracker app. Was more the fact that my battery power was getting depleted so rapidly, sometimes within 2 hours post-full charge. I found myself charging my phone at least 5  times a day. And at times, this became very stressful."
	- "The only issue was my phone loses service often. I have the oldest i phone available on the market so it is very unreliable. I never turned off my GPS location but quite often it would not record me going somewhere."
	- "Sometimes it didn't ping my location very accurately."
	- "I disliked how much the app drained my battery."

	Comments [sleep monitor] --> note: a lot of people also liked using the sleep monitor. Didn't add these comments in yet because wasn't sure we wanted to focus on sleep monitor since wasn't used in active-passive comparison:
	- "Would be better if it would just connect automaticly."
	- "It was difficult to use the monitor as I was transitioning between multiple locations."
	- "There were problems with the sleep monitor in that I was not able to activate the monitor when I was going to sleep."
	- "The only problem i had was sometimes it would disconnect in the middle of the night."
	- "Sometimes it recorded all night but when I pressed I'm up there was no data recorded."
	- "It didn't seem to work reliably for me, so I think that was the biggest cause of my reluctance to use it/spend time (albeit only a few seconds) adjusting the monitor strip to be properly under me."
	- "I wish I used it with my iPad because Bluetooth killa my batteries and I use my phone as an alarm."
	- "I take a lot of naps, which significantly interferes with its accuracy."
	- "I liked it i wish it cover more of the bed because sometimes i rolled off of it."
	- "I just had problems with connecting some nights. Also i got a different mattress and i had problems with it reading."
	

	
	Also could mention individual preferences with how people use their phone (i.e., deleting text messages right, keeping location turned off, turning phone off at times).
	
	Comments:  
	- "Understandable but i usually have my location turned off on my phone."
	- "I wasn’t always good at completing the surveys. My phone in general can be a bit of a stressor, so there were times I just wanted to keep my phone off."
	- "I just sometimes would miss them [EMA] throughout the day because i would have to silence my phone."
	- "The only way this impacted me at all was in that I couldn't clear my log history on a consistent basis, which I usually like to do. Otherwise, perfectly comfortable process."
	- "Not being able to clear my messages and keep my phone cleaned up bugs me!"
	- "I disliked saving my text messages. I like deleting them when I'm done."
	- "I didn't like not being able to delete calls  and  texts. I like a tidy phone."
