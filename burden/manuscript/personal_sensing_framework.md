Kendra's description of personal sensing

- A personal sensing platform consists of all hardware (e.g., smartphone, wearable sensor) and software (e.g., apps, cloud storage, API access) needed for the generation and retrieval of raw data streams. A platform can be limited to sensing a single raw data stream or it can be flexible enough to capture multiple sources of data.

- Personal sensing can be coarsely categorized as active or passive in terms of effort. Active methods require frequent (i.e., at least daily) interactions with the personal sensing platform and as such place more effort on the individual using the platform. Passive methods require minimal interactions (i.e., installing an app and setting permissions once) with the personal sensing platform and operate passively in the background.

- Importantly, a personal sensing method can be active in different places. One example is during data generation. An EMA method is active at this point in that it requires individuals to generate the data via self-report. On the other hand, a method for sensing geolocation is passive in that people do not need to input their location. Another place where a method can be active is at the point where the researcher or clinician needs to access or retrieve the data. In this case raw data streams that are automatically uploaded to cloud storage would be considered passive, but manual uploads would be considered active.

- Additionally, two personal sensing methods may sense the same raw data stream but differ in activeness. In our study, our method for sensing sleep quality and duration was active (i.e., participants had to interact with the platform to turn it on each night and off each morning). As technology advances, we can easily imagine a sleep monitoring method that is more passive (e.g., a one-time installment of a blue tooth enabled sensor under the mattress). Thus, while the activeness of the raw data stream is relatively stable, there may be room for improving the personal sensing platform and ultimately reducing burden on the individual using the sensing platform.


JJC notes on personal sensing terms:

- Personal sensing is a method
- Raw data (streams)
- We derive measures from the raw data
- Measures can be predictors or outcomes
- They are generally measures of constructs or objective behaviors/events
- We use platforms that consist of hardware (sensors, storage) and software (apps)
