He also plans to contact study staff upon discharge; Participant had called several times prior to FU1 and had been very difficult to understand over the phone both hearing what he was saying but also understanding what he was asking. At his in person FU1 visit the RA (MS) was hoping to clear up any questions or concerns that the participant had. However it was very difficult to understand what the participant was asking and seemed annoyed that staff was not understanding what he was saying. Participant also made comments about deleting text and call logs but then denied doing this when asked for clarification on when the last time he had done this. Participant also made uncomfortable comments referencing porn and asking RA to take a walk and do the visit outside. After all this it was determined that it would be best to stop the visit and withdraw the participant by Susan and Candace; Participant was withdrawn from project prior to visit completion.,Low GPS percentage; Samsung Edge S7; Location information was collected at FU1 but addresses were not gone over with participant; Participant reported turning off his phone while in inpatient treatment (07/08-07/13); At some point he disabled his location tracking services for a non-study related reason and tracking was resumed on 07/18; Missing: 7/01-7/03/19 7/07-7/12 7/14-7/15,,"Call and SMS logs were collected at FU1 but numbers were not gone over with participant.; at FU 1 - Participant made several comments about his phone and text logs. All of which were unclear to the RA. He said he cleared his phone and deleted things, but wanted to do what was most comfortable to me (the RA). Overall, I had a very difficult time understanding what he was saying. When I left to complete the phone transfer, I discussed the participant with Candace and Susan and it was decided that participant should be withdrawn from the study. We collected text and call logs, but did not actually go over them with the participant.",,

If it is resolved prior to Follow-Up #3 I will collect them then; Susan completed phone transfer during FU3; Several contacts were real people but the participant did not have the numbers saved.
