138,R_2YzIprHKwFZTFaH,recode_one,subid,139,138,HM,"There are two followup 3s for subject 139 and zero for 138. In addition, there is a follow-up 2 for subject 139 on the same day. Calendars, RAs, and other information support this change. Subject 139 came in for a make-up FU2 session on the same day that 138 came in for a scheduled FU3, and RA mistakenly marked the FU3 session form and survey dated 2019/1/08 as being for 139 (when it was really for 138). There were two final visits scheduled for the focal day with subjects 138 and 135 (the visit with 135 is marked as ""RESCHEDULE""). Kerry was scheduled to work with 138, although the entry for that visit was modified about a month after the final visit took place. There is one followup survey from the focal day with RA Kerry and subid 139 and one session form for followup 3 with RA Megan and subid 139.The dates for previous follow ups place 139 mid-month and 138 early-month.

There was a FU3 with a StudyName of ""81"" and a SubID of ""RISK"".The timing of that FU3 aligns with the scheduled FU3 for subject 81.; KW: Changed from recode_one to note entry since we do not keep studyname as variable and causes an error when cleaning function is run. We should discuss if we want to retain StudyName as a variable."
