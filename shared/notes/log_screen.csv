155,R_3j9vNPmoZjEumL0,note,,,,staff,"Partial response to ID Screen Battery. Responses to the survey seemed questionable as to whether the participant was being honest and reading the questions as they responded. The participant took approximately 2.5 hours to complete 78% of the survey before research staff ended the session. The participant had alerted the research staff twice during the course of the survey that they had been locked out of the iPad, and when the research staff entered the room to end the session they witnessed the participant quickly tapping on random bubbles without reading the questions. The participant was given a pending eligibility status, but has been deemed ineligible due to dishonest responses to the ID Screen Battery and for noticeably exceeding an appropriate amount of time to complete the survey"
