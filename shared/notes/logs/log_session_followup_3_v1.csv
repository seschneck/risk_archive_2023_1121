139,R_31FMHO8tQ8SsSkf,session_followup3_1.csv,recode_one,subid,139,138,HM,"There are two followup 3s for subject 139 and zero for 138. In addition, there is a follow-up 2 for subject 139 on the same day. Calendars, RAs, and other information support this change. Subject 139 came in for a make-up FU2 session on the same day that 138 came in for a scheduled FU3, and RA mistakenly marked the FU3 session form and survey dated 2019/1/08 as being for 139 (when it was really for 138). There were two final visits scheduled for the focal day with subjects 138 and 135 (the visit with 135 is marked as ""RESCHEDULE""). Kerry was scheduled to work with 138, although the entry for that visit was modified about a month after the final visit took place. There is one followup survey from the focal day with RA Kerry and subid 139 and one session form for followup 3 with RA Megan and subid 139.The dates for previous follow ups place 139 mid-month and 138 early-month. "
193,R_2ZKdCl1CA2ZC1XO,session_followup3_1.csv,recode_one,subid,193,179,HM,"There were four visits scheduled for the focal date, three were described as FU3 (for 193 - Kerry, 188 - Jill, 179 - Kerry, with Megan as shadow) and one was described as an ""additional visit"". There are three FU3 surveys, one for 193 (with Kerry), one for 188 (with Jill) and one for 179 (with Kerry). There are four FU3 session forms, one for 193 (with Megan), 188 (Jill), 179 (nobody listed & marked as ""fake data""), and 193 again (Megan). It seems that for the scheduled session with 179 at 11, Megan did a trial session and entered the correct subid but the wrong time, and Kerry completed the real form, but entered the incorrect subid of the person she ran earlier in the day."
