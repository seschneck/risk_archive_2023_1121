### Notes
This script creates a single csv file from the three raw data session FU12 files. Uses cleaning function to clean according to data log. Includes file merging and minimal variable renaming (only to merge files with inconsistent names).    

Inputs:   

* session_followup_12_v1.csv  
* session_followup_12_v2.csv  
* session_followup_12_v3.csv  
* log_session_followup_12_v2.csv
* log_session_followup_12_v3.csv

There is no log for v1.

Output:  

* session_followup_12.csv

### Merge data sets
```{r}
fu_12_session <- session_1 %>% 
  full_join(session_2) %>% 
  full_join(session_3) %>% 
  glimpse()

rm(session_1, session_2, session_3)
```


### EDA

The earliest recorded report is from `r min(fu_12_session$start_date, na.rm = TRUE)` 
and the most recent is from `r max(fu_12_session$start_date, na.rm = TRUE)`. 

All timezones in UTC
```{r}
fu_12_session %>% 
  select(start_date, end_date) %>% 
  map(tz)

print(fu_12_session$start_date)
print(fu_12_session$end_date)
```

UTC values that do not fall within range of start_date to end_date
```{r}
options(tibble.print_max = Inf)

fu_12_session %>% 
  mutate(utc = as_datetime(utc, tz = "UTC")) %>% 
  select(subid, start_date, end_date, utc) %>% 
  filter(!(utc >= start_date & utc <= end_date))

fu_12_session %>% 
  mutate(utc = as_datetime(utc, tz = "UTC")) %>% 
  select(subid, start_date, end_date, utc) %>% 
  filter(date(utc) != date(start_date))
```

UTCs match start date (1 hour ahead for some in months End of March - October).  
Subid 9 has UTC that follows same pattern (1 hour ahead of start date), however, start_date time listed as 11:50 pm so UTC crosses over into next day. Time likely incorrect (start to end time = 3 min), but according to enrollment db the date is correct (9-05-2017).  


#### Duplicate subids

```{r}
fu1 <- fu_12_session %>% 
  filter(ssfu_2 == "Followup #1")
fu2 <- fu_12_session %>% 
  filter(ssfu_2 == "Followup #2")
```


`r length(unique(fu_12_session$subid))` participants contribute to a total of `r nrow(fu_12_session)` 
reports.  

`r length(unique(fu1$subid))` participants in followup #1 contributing to `r nrow(fu1)` observations.    
`r length(unique(fu2$subid))` participants in followup #2 contributing to `r nrow(fu2)` observations.  

Duplicate subids due to no shows  

No shows - subid 61 never made it in for their FU_1 visit
```{r}
fu_12_session %>% 
  filter(is.na(ssfu_5)) %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```


#### Missing values

Missing (NA) values
```{r}
fu_12_session %>% 
  naniar::miss_var_summary() %>% 
  kbl(digits = 2, table.attr = "style='width:40%;'") %>% 
  kable_classic(position = "l") %>% 
  add_header_above(c("Missing values by variable" = 3), bold = TRUE) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

Missing ssfu_5 (time arrived) values represent no shows documented.  
ssfu_10 ("If no please explain below (interview form updated)") and ssfu_17 ("If no please explain below (ema form updated)") was blank for all participants.   

FIX: subid 98 has a completely blank FU 2 session form other than arrival time. No notes why.  

Nothing else appears problematic in missing data.  

Reasons for missing data include:  
* participants discontinuing or being withdrawn due to eligibility reasons before completing session  
* questions changed across 3 versions so some were only asked on a single survey version  
* questions were conditional (e.g., ssfu_35 = "If no, please explain below why session is incomplete.")  


#### Descriptives

```{r}
kabyl <- compose(
  partial(kable_classic, position = "left"),
  partial(kbl, digits = 2, table.attr = "style='width:50%;'"),
