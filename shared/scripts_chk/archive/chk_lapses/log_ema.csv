No other emas reference a time period about the use. Since she finished her survey at 5 pm, maybe the 5 was her trying to reference the current time? She didn't report any more drinking at her next ema at 11 pm that day. Very confident that the lapse end date should be 11/2. Given the lack of indicaction of continued drinking at 11 pm, I think 5 pm is our best estimate of the end time. S: Agree, but will still check with John since it is strange. She didnt report durinking during her 14:00 or 16:00 emas (which is weird..if she was drinking the whole time) It is also possible that the start and end times need to be flipped (e.g. she reported lapses from 5 am to 1 pm), but I don't think that is likely due to the history of the sub drinking later in the day vs the morning.",later,Data log entry,1572734206,change end date to 11/2 and end time to 17(?).,NO EVIDENCE;  JJC: APPROVE,,,,,,,,,,,

Data log mentions the sub was ""devastated"" by her relapse around this time but did not mention dates, however since the audio mentions a multi-day lapse I think we should trust all reports of drinking during this time. Therefore, I propose to change the lapse start and end dates for this lapse to 5/18 to indicate drinking the previous evening (even though the sub reported no drinking at her 23 ema on 5/18, I feel the audio are supportive enough of drinking to overrule that).
