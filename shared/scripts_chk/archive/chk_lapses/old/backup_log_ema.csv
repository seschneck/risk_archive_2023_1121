This survey was completed 10 seconds before the survey right after it (resp ID R_vHR0jiGhMl5EFQR). This survey reports a lapse on  5-19 16 - 23, the other says 5/20 10-13, and a third ema report on 5/20 reports  overnight lapse on 5-19 23 - 5/20 10 am. Audio reports 5/17 (completed at 11:59 pm) - 5/19 (completed at 1 pm) are all very strange, short, discuss hating their life, and I think suggests likely drinking on all of these days. However the sub completed all emas on 5/17 and 18 and did not report drinking on any of them which goes against this notion. Audio on 5/21 reports they have been drinking the past few days and need to stop. Even though this and the survey below were taken close together, I believe the participant may have been trying to first report a lapse from the previous night (this survey) and then a lapse during the day leading up to the current survey (on the next survey). Data log mentions the sub was ""devastated"" by her relapse around this time but did not mention dates, however since the audio mentions a multi-day lapse I think we should trust all reports of drinking during this time. Therefore, I propose to change the lapse start and end dates for this lapse to 5/18 to indicate drinking the previous evening (even though the sub reported no drinking at her 23 ema on 5/18, I feel the audio are supportive enough of drinking to overrule that). We could potentially extend this all the way back to 5/17, but that has even more empty lapse reports on 5/18 to go against this decision.

This lapse is the only lapse reported across all emas for 5/9, but it is impossible for her to have predicted this lapse in the future (the report is made at 14, but says the lapse was from 11pm - midnight on the same day).There are two options I see: 1) she made a typo with the times and meant 11 am - 12 pm (instead of 11pm to midnight here), or 2) this was her extending her lapse report from the night before (completed at 23:05, reporting a lapse at 23) to midnight (this is the first report the next day and her first chance to report drinking until midnight). The sub typically lapses at night which makes me skeptical of option 1, but option two requires more assumptions than a typo (all of her other ema reports on 5/9 and 5/10 do not report drinking, so we would have to assume one of these was incorrect and change it to report drinking on 5/9..but we don't know anything about when this lapse would have occured since the sub just said on 5/10 that they drank a little yesterday and did not provide an ema on 5/9).

Sub does not report drinking on any 9/23 emas and did not report ema at last ema before this on 9/24 (14). The start time of 20 could be a round up from ema completion time (5 min round up, ok to leave as is). The only explanation I can think of is that the end time is a typo and should also be 20.

This person had 3 separate lapses on 10/26. She reported a lapse from 1pm-3pm and 8pm-9pm (same as this one but reported at 10pm) This means that she probably lapsed at some point between 4pm and 8pm but reported the time wrong. Given that she reported 3 lapses in one day I wonder if it would be cleaner to say that it was one big lapse even though the times might not overlap. S: We have two options for this lapse 1) we can have it occupy the full space between the end of the last lapse 15 (reported at the previous ema) and the current ema end time (round up to 19). This would create a continuous chain of lapses as you suggest. or 2) we could only report a static lapse at 18. I think its safer to do as you suggest.,Lapse/report length,2019-10-26 18:46:07,2019-10-26 18:46:07,2019-10-26 18:48:45,2019-10-26 18:48:45,10-26-2019,20,10-26-2019,21,America/Chicago,1,-1.2313888888888889,1572137167,later

EMAL_1.3 should also be 11/02/2019. The time listed in EMAL_1.4 is incorrect. The participant reported that she drank a lot so she doesnt recall much from this drinking episode. -Candace. In her audio message on 11/3 the participant reports having 2 shots; she reports it wasnt her intention to get drunk but to resolve pain and she stopped when she wasnt in pain anymore. No other emas reference a time period about the use. Since she finished her survey at 5 pm, maybe the 5 was her trying to reference the current time? She didn't report any more drinking at her next ema at 11 pm that day. Very confident that the lapse end date should be 11/2. Given the lack of indicaction of continued drinking at 11 pm, I think 5 pm is our best estimate of the end time. S: Agree, but will still check with John since it is strange. She didnt report durinking during her 14:00 or 16:00 emas (which is weird..if she was drinking the whole time) It is also possible that the start and end times need to be flipped (e.g. she reported lapses from 5 am to 1 pm), but I don't think that is likely due to the history of the sub drinking later in the day vs the morning.",Lapse/report length,2019-11-02 17:36:46,2019-11-02 17:36:46,2019-11-02 17:39:22,2019-11-02 17:39:22,11-02-2019,13,08-01-2019,5,America/Chicago,-2240,4.612777777777778,1572734206,later
