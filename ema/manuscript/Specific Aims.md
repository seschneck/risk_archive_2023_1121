**Specific Aims**
1. Build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict future lapses back to opioid use using EMA data.
2. Interpret that model using SHAP values.
3. a. Evaluate model for fairness (equity and parity) across subgroups of race, sex, age, geographic location, income, and length of recovery. 
   b. Interpret top contributing features for each subgroup.
   

**Framing of study**
- Relapse prevention model
- Potential for Tx matching based on top features contributing to lapse risk
- Issues of fairness in machine learning/need to evaluate robustness of model before deploying


**Outstanding questions/discussion items**
- How might using demographics as features in overall model overlap with aim 3?
- Use most clinically useful lag and prediction windows from risk 1
-
