# Inclusion of Children

This is a template for preparing an NIH grant document.  It can be knit to word or pdf.  You can delete the R-code chunk if there is no R code to execute

## Header Level 2

This heading forces normal text to the next line.

### Header Level 3.  

This is a run-in or linked heading style where this text should follow on the same line as the H3. You will need to manually add a period after the H3 header but the spacing after that is automatic.

Here is more text.

### Header Level 3, number 2 which is an even longer header like a full sentence to test the indent. 

This is a run-in or linked heading style where this text should follow on the same line as the H3. You will need to manually add a period after the H3 header but the spacing after that is automatic.


```{=latex}
\captionsetup[figure]{labelformat=empty}
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\linewidth} % Use R or L, not r or l,  to preserve floats. Second bracket specifies 50% of your line width for the caption area
  \begin{center}
```

```{r out.width = "100%",  echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("mediation.jpg") #NB out.width = 100% means the caption should fill 100% of the available width (which in this case is 50%)
```
<!-- John note that I had to crop this figure as it had a huge blank right margin -->
