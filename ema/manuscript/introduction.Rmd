# This is a Level 1 header

This is a template for preparing an NIH grant document.  It can be knit to word or pdf.  You can delete the R-code chunk if there is no R code to execute.  Lets cite this paper [@chihPredictiveModelingAddiction2014]

## Header Level 2

This heading forces normal text to the next line.

### Header Level 3.  

This is a run-in or linked heading style where this text should follow on the same line as the H3. You will need to manually add a period after the H3 header but the spacing after that is automatic.

Here is more text.

### Header Level 3, number 2 which is an even longer header like a full sentence to test the indent. 

This is a run-in or linked heading style where this text should follow on the same line as the H3. You will need to manually add a period after the H3 header but the spacing after that is automatic.
