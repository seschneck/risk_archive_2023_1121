These are Sarah's notes on machine learning prediction model literature

Cited papers were limited to lapse prediction papers *using EMA as a predictor.* Chih is the only alcohol *LAPSE* prediction paper as we define lapse (an instance of goal inconsistent alcohol use by a person with an AUD who is attempting not to drink).

These papers predict instances of alcohol use with EMA, but not goal inconsistent use (all cited in paragraph beginning despite this initial promise):

* Soyster 2022 -- Used EMA to predict alcohol consumption and alcohol craving in the next two hours. Population: college students who had drank alcohol before (not AUD, not treatment seeking)

* Bae 2018 - Detection (not prediction) of high risk drinking windows every 2 hours using EMA from previous days and mobile senors. Population 38 non-treatment seeking heavy drinking young adults

* Walters 2021 - Used EMA to identify predictors of imminent drinking (drinking alcohol is the next 4 hours, only predicting first drink of the day). Population: adults experienceing homelessness (non treatment seeking)

* Not cited -- Katardjiev et al 2019 "A machie learning based approach to forecasting alcoholic relapses). Only paper predicting instances of alcohol lapse in a clinical sample, not included because EMA was not a predictor (just used bio sensor data). Made day level predictions of drinking/non drinking days 5 days in advance using daily breathalyzer data from individuals in treatment program for AUD. -->
