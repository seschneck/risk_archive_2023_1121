Self-monitoring is thought to be a valuable and necessary tool during recovery from AUD and other SUDs.
* Anecdotally - encouraged by clinicians, prompted by many self-help tools/apps, etc.
* Empirically? Might be some evidence (Ariela's review & continued lit review)
* Consider ARCP framing - there is a strongly held belief about monitoring perhaps without *sufficient evidence* and/or without *sufficient nuance* to how monitoring should be implemented

Self-monitoring, insight, and/or confidence in remaining abstinent/pursuing treatment goals has traditionally been measured statically.
* Measures like the AASE are often used to assess an individual's "long-term" likelihood of remaining abstinent
* Scores from measures like the AASe may be used at the end of treatment/end of study/etc. to estimate an individual's future likelihood of staying abstinent
* It is *unclear if or how clinicians use or might use static measures like the AASE* (e.g., in determining treatment conclusion or retention, in determining level of care, etc.)

It is *unclear how well static measures like the AASE predict future lapse/relapse outcomes*.

Risk of lapse/relapse is best understood *dynamically*.
* Relapse prevention model
* Fluctuating risk over time due to fluctuating proximal and distal risk factors that interact fluidly with one another
* Thus, *monitoring dynamic risk of lapse likely requires dense, dynamic monitoring to be effective*.

*EMA* offers a method to assess individuals' insight into risk of lapse densely and longitudinally.
* This has/has not? (look at review) been done before (check Y/N, duration of monitoring, question being asked, etc.)
* When done, it has/has not? (look at review) been done with *true prediction*.

Continuous monitoring with EMA can be embedded within a digital therapeutic context that can allow for monitoring of other risk factors and offer access to supports and tools to be used throughout recovery.

In the current study, we measured individuals' insight into their own lapse risk via daily EMA surveys situated within a digital therapeutic. 
* Thus, insight was assessed in a way that was: *cued* (i.e., prompted to reflect), *contextualized* (i.e., asked at the end of the survey assessing 9 other relevant risk factors), and *continuous* (i.e., daily assessments).
* Question was asked about individuals' risk of lapsing in the next week, so we used corresponding 1-week outcome windows that began at the time of the daily survey completion.
* *Primary question* is how well dynamic measurement of insight can predict dynamic lapse risk.

We will compare this dynamic assessment of insight to several other prediction models:
* How well static insight measured via AASE can predict whether an indidivual will lapse or not (comparable to how this measure might be used clinically)
* How well static insight measured via AASE can predict dynamic lapse risk (i.e., using the same 1-week rolling windows)
* How well a full EMA system embedded in a dtx context (4x daily surveys) can predict dynamic lapse risk.
