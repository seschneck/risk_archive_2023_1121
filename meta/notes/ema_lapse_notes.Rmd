## 001

-  Participant stopped receiving text messages from the survey line on 4/19/17. RA attempted to troubleshoot with participant over the telephone, but RA attempts were unsuccessful. Lab Manager spent time troubleshooting issue with participant while he was in the lab and discovered that he had the survey line blocked. The number was unblocked and test text messages were sent and received. The issue is now solved.   

**First lab visit after 4/19/17 from visit dates is 5/1/17. EMA's may be missing or incomplete from 4/19/17 - 5/1/17**   


## 002

- Participant reports that she has received multiple “bedtime” surveys. She reports that three EMAs have come in at 1:30 am. She also reports that she has gotten double “bedtime” EMAs delivered.    


## 003  

- Participant reported that she has received her bedtime [EMA] survey late a handful of times.   


## 017

- No-Show for FU#1 and FU #2 (Spouse called to report that participant entered an in-patient treatment program); Very low compliance.    


## 029

- last EMA 1/22/17  


## 031

- 12/4/2017: Participant 031 was getting EMA surveys with test as the embedded subid instead of 031. The problem in Survey Signal was corrected and the EMAs that 031 had completed were edited in Qualtrics so that the subid is now 031 (see next bullet for more info).   

- 2/26/2018: in EMAM morning battery subid test at the following UTCs were changed to subid 031 - 1512392452; 1512309553; 1512227465; 1512133243; 1512047106; 1511960486; 2/26/2018: in EMAL later battery subid test at the following utcs were changed to subid 31 - 1512407036; 1512335063; 1512326855; 1512269438; 1512178633; 1512169637; 1512087509; 1512074607; 1512006978; 1511984753.   

- 2/27/2018: Reviewed unfinished EMA responses with the participant at follow-up 3. They had no lapses and did not report any lapses.   


## 032

- Participant lost their phone for a few days in December


## 033

- 03/15/2018 - Participant completed her final study visit. RA reviewed the incomplete/”false” surveys with the participant. The participant completed the first question on EMA Later surveys dated 1/1/18 and 1/16/18. The participant reported that she accidentally answered the first question as “yes” for the 1/1/18 survey as it should have been no. On the 1/16/18 survey the participant answered “no,” and this is accurate. This information is also in the RISK project Data Log. 


## 034

- 3/27/2018: Participant 034 – RA reviewed participant’s unfinished response recorded on February 13th, 2018. Participant confirmed that they answered EMAM_1.1-1.5 correctly, but simply didn’t finish the rest of the survey.     


## 042

- One ema was completed during this reported lapse at 12:56 AM (4/10/18). Given how early this is it still seems possible that they had been drinking at the reported times; No emas were completed on 03/15.   


## 043

- One ema was completed on 04/08 at 16:20 with no lapses to report; No emas were completed in between that one and this survey lending support that this was a legitimately reported lapse   

**Not sure I understand this note. Did not come from data log**


## 044

- About 4 surveys were not delivered to the participants phone. There was not a pattern with these EMAs, but the participant was advised to inform the study staff if the issue worsened.  


## 047

- Was not receiving EMA messages between 04/06/2018 and 04/17/2018.; Participant has been having EMA issues since 4/5/2018; Participant was not consistent with responding to EMAs when they were being received, which is why they were discontinued; EMA issues still unresolved as of 4/16/2018; Had a lapse on 4/10/2018 at 4:00pm recorded by RA Jill on 4/11/2018 after tech troubleshooting appointment

## 048

- Audio on 04/01 mentioned drinking and sub did their ema at 9pm so even though there was no explicit note that the drinking was specifically for that day I think it is a safe assumption. However they already reported a lapse on 04/01 from 17:00-21:00. Their audio message on 04/02 mentioned that they were going to the brewer game and were going to drink there. This leads me to believe that this is a typo for 04/02 instead of 04/01
