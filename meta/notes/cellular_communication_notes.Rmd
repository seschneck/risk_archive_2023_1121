## 009

- Subject’s SMS files are empty because the subject deleted all text messages before their study visit; They also did not text much.  


## 027 

- Unable to get unreported contacts at FU #1 as the R script was not working properly.   





## 032

- Participant bought a new phone in the first month of the study and so we collected call/sms logs from both phones at Follow Up 1.   


## 034

- Has only 2 Voice/sms files as they missed their Follow up 2 appointment therefore staff was only able to retrieve the logs at Follow Up 1 and Follow Up 3.  


## 052

- At followup 1 participant had very few text messages because they forgot to keep their messages and so they were just deleting them. The participant was reminded that we collect that info as part of their study participation and that we would like them to not delete texts that they feel comfortable sharing. They forgot to bring their old phone to followup one but they brought it to FU2 where voice and SMS logs were downloaded.    


## 056 

- 05/09/2018: Due to an error in the messages script when Call and SMS logs were transferred unreported contacts were not able to be reported at their Follow-up 1. One of their text messages did not have a handle_id so it could not be linked to a phone number. They will be collected at Follow-up 2.    


## 066

- RA does not trust the contacts data given at FU #2 and FU#3. The participant seemed to be in a rush and marked several contacts irrelevant/spam and neglected to answer the contact follow-up questions when asked directly by RA
- From FU3 session form - RA does not believe the participant gave quality data. She marked irrelevant spam for all of the unreported contacts she was asked about. Additionally, RA only had the opportunity to review one unreported contact because the participant had to leave to go to work. She arrived 20 minutes late for her visit and had to leave 40 minutes later, so we did not have time to complete the appointment. The participant did not tell RA ahead of time that she only had a short time to meet.


## 074

- Unable to retrieve the phone and text message logs from the participant at Follow-up 1 since their phone is broken and will not turn on. The SMS and voice files are on their phone but will have to be missing data.   

## 081

- Participant’s partner is incarcerated. She reported that all of the phone calls that come up as restricted or unknown are incoming calls from her partner. She reported that she speaks to him frequently.   


## 082

- Participant only has 1 call and 1 SMS log due to reported stolen phone   


## 084 

- Participant didn’t have many phone calls or text messages    


## 130

- Unable to run Unreported Contacts at both Follow-up 1 and 2 due to error in R from participants SMS logs. Resolved by Follow-up 3 and Unreported Contacts were reported; There will only be SMS and Voice files for visits _1 and _3. This is correct and still captures 90 full days of data even though there are only 64 distinct days with observations for Voice (<1 call made per day).   

## 135 

- Participant is missing Call and SMS logs for their Final Visit due to their phone having been reported lost/stolen shortly before their final visit date.   


## 138

- Participant only has 4 Voice files once compliance is run for All. This seems to be accurate due to the participants small Voice transfer files and low number of unreported contacts at each follow-up visit.  


## 161 

- Since participant got a new phone before their Followup1 they brought both phones to their visit. Both phones were backed up with the new phone producing the two files and the old producing one.   
- Took FU2 survey from home. Unreported contacts for FU2 and FU3 collected at final visit.  


## 162

- Participant was unable to reschedule their Follow up 2 appointment therefore there will only be 2 Voice and SMS files in their raw data folder.  


## 166

- according to data log 4 contact numbers were removed because they were duplicates. Exact information listed in logs.

## 167

- Staff were unable to tether participants phone to the laptop at the time of their follow-up 1 visit but were able to email Call and SMS logs to study email and download them from there; At Follow-up Visits 2&3 staff had to share SMS Backup and Restore downloads via the participants Google Drive as the files were too large to email. This method was effective and the files were transferred and permanently deleted from the laptop and Google Drive account.  
- According to data log one duplicate contact entry was removed from the contacts excel file. Information about this contact is in the subid's data log.
