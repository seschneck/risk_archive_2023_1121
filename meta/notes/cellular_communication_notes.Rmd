## 009

- Subject’s SMS files are empty because the subject deleted all text messages before their study visit; They also did not text much.  


## 027 

- Unable to get unreported contacts at FU #1 as the R script was not working properly.   


## 028

- At FU2 - participant acknowledged that they hadn’t been as diligent in answering surveys, but will make a concerted effort in their final month of study participation.  


## 032

- Participant bought a new phone in the first month of the study and so we collected call/sms logs from both phones at Follow Up 1.   


## 034

- Has only 2 Voice/sms files as they missed their Follow up 2 appointment therefore staff was only able to retrieve the logs at Follow Up 1 and Follow Up 3.  


## 052

- At followup 1 participant had very few text messages because they forgot to keep their messages and so they were just deleting them. The participant was reminded that we collect that info as part of their study participation and that we would like them to not delete texts that they feel comfortable sharing. They forgot to bring their old phone to followup one but they brought it to FU2 where voice and SMS logs were downloaded.    


## 056 

- 05/09/2018: Due to an error in the messages script when Call and SMS logs were transferred unreported contacts were not able to be reported at their Follow-up 1. One of their text messages did not have a handle_id so it could not be linked to a phone number. They will be collected at Follow-up 2.    


## 066

- RA does not trust the contacts data given at FU #2 and FU#3. The participant seemed to be in a rush and marked several contacts irrelevant/spam and neglected to answer the contact follow-up questions when asked directly by RA
- From FU3 session form - RA does not believe the participant gave quality data. She marked irrelevant spam for all of the unreported contacts she was asked about. Additionally, RA only had the opportunity to review one unreported contact because the participant had to leave to go to work. She arrived 20 minutes late for her visit and had to leave 40 minutes later, so we did not have time to complete the appointment. The participant did not tell RA ahead of time that she only had a short time to meet.


## 074
