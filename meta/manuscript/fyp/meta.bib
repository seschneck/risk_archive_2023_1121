  abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) are chronic conditions, but the severity of symptomatic experiences and functional impairments vacillate over the course of illness. Developing unobtrusive remote monitoring systems to detect early warning signs of impending symptomatic relapses would allow clinicians to intervene before the patient’s condition worsens. Objective: In this study, we aim to create the first models, exclusively using passive sensing data from a smartphone, to predict behavioral anomalies that could indicate early warning signs of a psychotic relapse. Methods: Data used to train and test the models were collected during the CrossCheck study. Hourly features derived from smartphone passive sensing data were extracted from 60 patients with SSDs (42 nonrelapse and 18 relapse {$>$}1 time throughout the study) and used to train models and test performance. We trained 2 types of encoder-decoder neural network models and a clustering-based local outlier factor model to predict behavioral anomalies that occurred within the 30-day period before a participant's date of relapse (the near relapse period). Models were trained to recreate participant behavior on days of relative health (DRH, outside of the near relapse period), following which a threshold to the recreation error was applied to predict anomalies. The neural network model architecture and the percentage of relapse participant data used to train all models were varied. Results: A total of 20,137 days of collected data were analyzed, with 726 days of data (0.037\%) within any 30-day near relapse period. The best performing model used a fully connected neural network autoencoder architecture and achieved a median sensitivity of 0.25 (IQR 0.15-1.00) and specificity of 0.88 (IQR 0.14-0.96; a median 108\% increase in behavioral anomalies near relapse). We conducted a post hoc analysis using the best performing model to identify behavioral features that had a medium-to-large effect (Cohen d{$>$}0.5) in distinguishing anomalies near relapse from DRH among 4 participants who relapsed multiple times throughout the study. Qualitative validation using clinical notes collected during the original CrossCheck study showed that the identified features from our analysis were presented to clinicians during relapse events. Conclusions: Our proposed method predicted a higher rate of anomalies in patients with SSDs within the 30-day near relapse period and can be used to uncover individual-level behaviors that change before relapse. This approach will enable technologists and clinicians to build unobtrusive digital mental health tools that can predict incipient relapse in SSDs.},

  abstract = {Background Limited research has focused on identifying the extent to which social networks impact the effectiveness of brief alcohol interventions delivered in trauma care settings. Objectives The research presented here examines the extent to which the percent of heavy drinkers and percent of abstainers in one’s social network moderates the effectiveness of a brief motivational intervention with and without a telephone booster on alcohol use among trauma patients. Method Secondary data analyses were conducted using data from 596 participants (456males) who were recruited from three urban Level I trauma centers. Patients were randomized to one of the three intervention conditions: brief advice (BA; n~=~200), brief motivational intervention (BMI; n~=~203), and BMI with a telephone booster (BMI~+~B; n~=~193). For the purpose of the present study, measures of alcohol-specific social network characteristics at baseline and alcohol use at 3- and 6-month follow-up were used. Results At low percentages (0\% to \textasciitilde 7\%) of people in one’s social network who are heavy drinkers, there was a negative, statistically significant effect of the BMI conditions versus the BA condition on alcohol use. However, percent of abstainers did not moderate the effects of the BMI conditions. Conclusion The results suggest that the BMI and BMI~+~B conditions may be most effective among patients with no heavy drinkers in their social networks. BMIs may benefit from including a component that addresses having one or more heavy drinkers in one’s social network.},

  abstract = {Aims: The main aim was to investigate the relative roles of mental distress and intrinsic motivation for relapse after inpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, while adjusting for demographics and treatment variables. Methods: The study is based on a prospective multicenter study with a baseline gross sample of 607 patients with SUD (response rate = 84\%) admitted to an inpatient stay at one of five specialized SUD treatment centers in Norway. The analytical sample consisted of patients with illicit drug use (n=374) who took part in a follow-up interview three months after discharge from inpatient treatment (n=249) (retention rate = 67\%). Data were collected using information from electronic medical records, a self-report questionnaire at treatment entry, and a follow-up interview. Results: Relapse occurred among 37\% of the sample by three-month follow-up. Results of multivariable analysis showed that younger age and having a psychiatric diagnosis were associated with an elevated relapse risk. Patients who received treatment at a short-term clinic (2-4 months), as opposed to a long-term clinic (more than 6 months) were also at increased risk of relapse, regardless of their length of stay. Reduced risk of relapse was predicted by having completed the inpatient treatment stay. Conclusion: Identifying the treatment needs of young patients and patients with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses during and following inpatient SUD treatment may contribute to reduced post-treatment relapse rates. Further research is needed to illuminate the treatment-related factors that contribute to reduced risk of relapse after inpatient SUD treatment.},

Smartphone sensing offers an opportunity to passively track alcohol usage and record associated drinking contexts. Drinkers can reflect on their drinking logs, detect patterns of abuse and self-correct or seek treatment. In this paper, we investigate whether a smartphone user’s alcohol intoxication level (how many drinks) can be inferred from their gait. Accelerometer data was gathered from the smartphones of a group of drinkers. Time and frequency domain features were then extracted and used for classification in a machine learning framework. Various classifiers were compared for a task of classifying the number of drinks consumed by a user into ranges of 0-2 drinks (sober), 3-6 drinks (tipsy) or {$>$}6 drinks (drunk). Random Forest proved to be the most accurate classifier, yielding 56\% accuracy on the training set, and 70\% accuracy on the validation set. Using these results, AlcoGait, an Android smartphone application was developed and evaluated by real users. The results of user studies were encouraging.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ({$>$}4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9\% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.},

Using smartphones and wearable devices to monitor the mental condition of patients with MDD has been examined in several studies. However, few studies have used passively collected data to monitor mood changes over time. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of monitoring mood status and stability of patients with MDD using machine learning models trained by passively collected data, including phone use data, sleep data, and step count data. Methods: We constructed 950 data samples representing time spans during three consecutive Patient Health Questionnaire-9 assessments. Each data sample was labeled as Steady or Mood Swing, with subgroups Steady-remission, Steady-depressed, Mood Swing-drastic, and Mood Swing-moderate based on patients’ Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores from three visits. A total of 252 features were extracted, and 4 feature selection models were applied; 6 different combinations of types of data were experimented with using 6 different machine learning models. Results: A total of 334 participants with MDD were enrolled in this study. The highest average accuracy of classification between Steady and Mood Swing was 76.67\% (SD 8.47\%) and that of recall was 90.44\% (SD 6.93\%), with features from all types of data being used. Among the 6 combinations of types of data we experimented with, the overall best combination was using call logs, sleep data, step count data, and heart rate data. The accuracies of predicting between Steady-remission and Mood Swing-drastic, Steady-remission and Mood Swing-moderate, and Steady-depressed and Mood Swing-drastic were over 80\%, and the accuracy of predicting between Steady-depressed and Mood Swing-moderate and the overall Steady to Mood Swing classification accuracy were over 75\%. Comparing all 6 aforementioned combinations, we found that the overall prediction accuracies between Steady-remission and Mood Swing (drastic and moderate) are better than those between Steady-depressed and Mood Swing (drastic and moderate). Conclusions: Our proposed method could be used to monitor mood changes in patients with MDD with promising accuracy by using passively collected data, which can be used as a reference by doctors for adjusting treatment plans or for warning patients and their guardians of a relapse.},

  abstract = {Background: Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems that automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can also provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance during problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used to treat major depressive disorder. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with Mobilyze!, a mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological momentary intervention and context sensing. Methods: We developed a mobile phone application and supporting architecture, in which machine learning models (ie, learners) predicted patients’ mood, emotions, cognitive/motivational states, activities, environmental context, and social context based on at least 38 concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global positioning system, ambient light, recent calls). The website included feedback graphs illustrating correlations between patients’ self-reported states, as well as didactics and tools teaching patients behavioral activation concepts. Brief telephone calls and emails with a clinician were used to promote adherence. We enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder in a single-arm pilot study to receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments for 8 weeks. Results: Promising accuracy rates (60\% to 91\%) were achieved by learners predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated on scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported depressive symptoms (betaweek = –.82, P {$<$} .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) and interview measures of depressive symptoms (betaweek = –.81, P {$<$} .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis (bweek = –.65, P = .03, per-protocol remission rate = 85.71\%). Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased (betaweek = –.71, P {$<$} .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 2.58). Conclusions: Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological momentary intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts to use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development process are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Adults who are homeless are more likely to have alcohol use disorders (AUDs) compared with domiciled adults. Although AUD treatments are commonly available, many factors (eg, transportation limitations and inability to schedule appointments) contribute to low treatment completion rates and low success rates of these interventions among adults experiencing homelessness. Most adults who are homeless own mobile phones; however, no interventions have been developed that use mobile devices to deliver and support AUD interventions for this population. Mobile phone–based AUD interventions may reduce barriers that have limited the use and utility of traditional interventions. Objective: The aim of this study is to (1) identify variables (eg, affect, stress, geolocation, and cravings) that predict drinking among homeless adults (phase I), (2) develop a mobile intervention that utilizes an algorithm to identify moments of risk for drinking and deliver treatment messages that are tailored to the individual’s current needs in real time (phase II), and (3) pilot test the intervention app (phase III). Methods: In phase I, adults experiencing homelessness with an AUD (N=80) will complete baseline, equipment, 2-week, and 4-week follow-up visits in person. Participants will be prompted to complete five daily ecological momentary assessments on a study-provided smartphone for 28 days. The smartphone app will collect GPS coordinates every 5 min for the entire 28-day study period. Participants will wear a transdermal alcohol sensor that will objectively measure alcohol use. In phase II, we will use phase I data to develop an algorithm that identifies moments of heightened risk for drinking and develop treatment messages that address risk factors for drinking. Phase III will pilot test the intervention in 40 adults experiencing homelessness with AUD. Results: This project was funded in June 2018. IRB approval was obtained in October 2018, and data collection for phase I began in February 2019. Phase III data collection is expected to conclude in 2020. To date, 80 participants have consented to the study, and data analysis for phase I will begin in early 2020. Conclusions: This research will highlight intervention targets and develop a novel intervention for understudied and underserved adults experiencing homelessness with AUD.

  abstract = {Background: Mobile phone based real-time ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) have been used to record health risk behaviors, and antecedents to those behaviors, as they occur in near real time. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if intensive longitudinal data, collected via mobile phone, could be used to identify imminent risk for smoking lapse among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers seeking smoking cessation treatment. Methods: Participants were recruited into a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial at an urban safety-net hospital tobacco cessation clinic. All participants completed in-person EMAs on mobile phones provided by the study. The presence of six commonly cited lapse risk variables (ie, urge to smoke, stress, recent alcohol consumption, interaction with someone smoking, cessation motivation, and cigarette availability) collected during 2152 prompted or self-initiated postcessation EMAs was examined to determine whether the number of lapse risk factors was greater when lapse was imminent (ie, within 4 hours) than when lapse was not imminent. Various strategies were used to weight variables in efforts to improve the predictive utility of the lapse risk estimator. Results: Participants (N=92) were mostly female (52/92, 57\%), minority (65/92, 71\%), 51.9 (SD 7.4) years old, and smoked 18.0 (SD 8.5) cigarettes per day. EMA data indicated significantly higher urges (P=.01), stress (P=.002), alcohol consumption (P{$<$}.001), interaction with someone smoking (P{$<$}.001), and lower cessation motivation (P=.03) within 4 hours of the first lapse compared with EMAs collected when lapse was not imminent. Further, the total number of lapse risk factors present within 4 hours of lapse (mean 2.43, SD 1.37) was significantly higher than the number of lapse risk factors present during periods when lapse was not imminent (mean 1.35, SD 1.04), P{$<$}.001. Overall, 62\% (32/52) of all participants who lapsed completed at least one EMA wherein they reported ≥3 lapse risk factors within 4 hours of their first lapse. Differentially weighting lapse risk variables resulted in an improved risk estimator (weighted area=0.76 vs unweighted area=0.72, P{$<$}.004). Specifically, 80\% (42/52) of all participants who lapsed had at least one EMA with a lapse risk score above the cut-off within 4 hours of their first lapse. Conclusions: Real-time estimation of smoking lapse risk is feasible and may pave the way for development of mobile phone based smoking cessation treatments that automatically tailor treatment content in real time based on presence of specific lapse triggers. Interventions that identify risk for lapse and automatically deliver tailored messages or other treatment components in real time},

  abstract = {Objective: Most attempts at smoking cessation are unsuccessful, and stress is frequently characterized both as a momentary precipitant of smoking lapse and a predictor of subsequent changes in other key precipitants of lapse. The current study examined longitudinal associations among stress, multiple precipitants of lapse, and lapse among smokers attempting to quit. Method: Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) were gathered from a multiethnic, gender-balanced sample of 370 adults enrolled in a smoking cessation program. EMAs (N = 32,563) assessed smoking lapse and precipitants of lapse, including stress, negative affect, smoking urge, abstinence self-efficacy, motivation to quit, difficulty concentrating, coping outcome expectancies, and smoking outcome expectancies. A multilevel structural equation model simultaneously estimated within-subject paths from stress to multiple precipitants and subsequent smoking lapse. Indirect effects of stress to smoking lapse through precipitants were computed. Results: Results indicated that increased stress was significantly associated with all precipitants of lapse, consistent with a greater risk for lapse (i.e., increased negative affect, smoking urge, difficulty concentrating, and smoking outcome expectancies and reduced abstinence self-efficacy, motivation to quit, and coping outcome expectancies). All precipitants were significantly associated with subsequent lapse. Indirect effects indicated that stress was uniquely connected to lapse through negative affect, smoking urge, abstinence self-efficacy, coping outcome expectancies, and smoking outcome expectancies. Conclusions: Results of this study highlight the broad importance of stress for smoking lapse during a quit attempt. Smoking cessation programs should pay close attention to the role of stress in exacerbating key precipitants of lapse to improve cessation success rates.

The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service, provided in A-CHESS, to track patients' recovery progress. The model showed good predictability, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.829 in the 10-fold cross-validation and 0.912 in the external validation. The sensitivity/specificity table assists the tradeoff decisions necessary to apply the model in practice.

Although rates of and time to relapse appear to be similar for treated adolescents and adults, this critical review of the literature on adolescent relapse begins with an overview of developmental differences between adolescent and adult substance users that need to be considered when studying relapse. A summary of rates of relapse in treated teens is followed by a review of results on the predictive validity of different relapse definitions. Next, characteristics of teens' initial relapse in terms of substances involved, situational context, and factors associated with relapse are described. Because relapse is ideally understood in the context of longer-term patterns of use, the review also discusses the extent to which early episodes of use mark clinically significant change points in post-treatment course, and how knowledge of longer-term clinical course is essential to understanding the relapse process and mechanisms underlying the maintenance of behavioral change.},

Motivated by statistical genetics, where nonlinear interactions are of particular interest, we introduce a novel and interpretable way to summarize the relative importance of predictor variables. Methodologically, we develop the "RelATive cEntrality" (RATE) measure to prioritize candidate genetic variants that are not just marginally important, but whose associations also stem from significant covarying relationships with other variants in the data. We illustrate RATE through Bayesian Gaussian process regression, but the methodological innovations apply to other "black box" methods. It is known that nonlinear models often exhibit greater predictive accuracy than linear models, particularly for phenotypes generated by complex genetic architectures. With detailed simulations and two real data association mapping studies, we show that applying RATE enables an explanation for this improved performance.},

  abstract = {Background—Following completion of substance use treatment, it is crucial for patients to continue to utilize skills learned in treatment for optimal treatment outcomes. Mobile applications (apps) on smartphones offer a unique platform to promote utilization of evidence-based skills following completion of substance use treatment. Despite the promise of mobile apps and smartphones for treatment delivery, it remains unknown whether patients in substance use treatment in the United States have access to smartphones and utilize mobile apps on smartphones. The present study sought to determine smartphone utilization among individuals enrolled in one residential substance use treatment center in the U.S catering specifically to low-income adults. Methods—Participants included 251 individuals at a residential substance use treatment center in Washington DC admitted to the center between March, 2014 and January, 2015. During the intake process, participants completed interviewer-administered demographics and psychiatric questionnaires as well as a self-report of technology utilization. Results—Results indicated that the majority of patients in this residential substance use treatment center owned mobile phones prior to treatment entry (86.9\%) and expected to own mobile phones after leaving treatment (92.6\%). Moreover, the majority of these phones were (68.5\%) or will be smartphones (72.4\%) on which patients reported utilizing mobile applications (Prior to treatment: 61.3\%; Post treatment: 64.3\%) and accessing the internet (Prior to treatment: 61.3\%; Post treatment: 65.9\%). Conclusions—Mobile phone and smartphone ownership among this sample were comparable to ownership among U.S. adults broadly. Findings suggest that smartphones and mobile apps may hold clinical utility for fostering continued use of treatment skills following substance use treatment completion.},

We then construct statistical models from a training set of observations of these measures before and after the reported childbirth, to forecast significant postpartum changes in mothers. The predictive models can classify mothers who will change significantly following childbirth with an accuracy of 71\%, using observations about their prenatal behavior, and as accurately as 80-83\% when additionally leveraging the initial 2-3 weeks of postnatal data. The study is motivated by the opportunity to use social media to identify mothers at risk of postpartum depression, an underreported health concern among large populations, and to inform the design of low-cost, privacy-sensitive early-warning systems and intervention programs aimed at promoting wellness postpartum.},

Numerous seminal and contemporary theories on SUD etiology posit that stressors may motivate drug use and that individuals who use drugs chronically may display altered responses to stressors. We use foundational basic stress biology research as a lens through which to evaluate critically the available evidence to support these key stress–SUD theses in humans. Additionally, we examine the field's success to date in targeting stressors and stressor reactivity in treatments for SUDs. We conclude with our recommendations for how best to advance our understanding of the relationship between stressors and drug use, and we discuss clinical implications for treatment development.

Although little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms that make this program effective, one frequently cited aspect is social support. In order to gain insight into the processes at work in AA, this paper reviewed 24 papers examining the relationship between AA and social network variables. Various types of social support were included in the review such as structural support, functional support, general support, alcohol-specific support, and recovery helping. Overall, this review found that AA involvement is related to a variety of positive qualitative and quantitative changes in social support networks. Although AA had the greatest impact on friend networks, it had less influence on networks consisting of family members or others. In addition, support from others in AA was found to be of great value to recovery, and individuals with harmful social networks supportive of drinking actually benefited the most from AA involvement. Furthermore, social support variables consistently mediated AA’s impact on abstinence, suggesting that social support is a mechanism in the effectiveness of AA in promoting a sober lifestyle.},

  abstract = {Today's health care is difficult to imagine without the possibility to objectively measure various physiological parameters related to patients symptoms (from temperature through blood pressure to complex tomographic procedures). Psychiatric care remains a notable exception that heavily relies on patient interviews and self assessment. This is due to the fact that mental illnesses manifest themselves mainly in the way patients behave throughout their daily life and, until recently there were no "behavior measurement devices". This is now changing with the progress in wearable activity recognition and sensor enabled smartphones. In this article we introduce a system, which, based on smartphone-sensing is able to recognize depressive and manic states and detect state changes of patients suffering from bipolar disorder. Drawing upon a real-life dataset of 10 patients, recorded over a time-period of 12 weeks (in total over 800 days of data tracing 17 state changes) by 4 different sensing modalities we could extract features corresponding to all disease-relevant aspects in behavior. Using these features we gain recognition accuracies of 76\% by fusing all sensor modalities and state change detection precision and recall of over 97\%. This article furthermore outlines the applicability of this system in the physician-patient relations in order to facilitate the life and treatment of bipolar patients.},

Subjects were followed weekly until relapse for a maximum of 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Structural and functional social support and support for abstinence and drug use were investigated. With demographic variables and drug-treatment group controlled, greater structural support (as measured by an index of social integration and by partner status) predicted a lower risk of relapse. Greater experienced partner support for abstinence also predicted lower risk. Social network members' use of the subject's problem drug predicted heightened relapse risk, but the effect was not statistically significant. This study contributes to a cross-drug model of relapse. It highlights the importance of social integration and abstinence-specific functional support in predicting the risk of relapse, independent of the particular drug of abuse.},

  abstract = {Background: Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Effective smoking cessation JITAI rely on the development of accurate decision rules that determine when someone is most likely to lapse. The primary goal of the present study was to identify the strongest predictors of first lapse among smokers undergoing a quit attempt. Methods: Smokers attending a clinic-based smoking cessation program (n = 74) were asked to complete ecological momentary assessments five times daily on study-provided smartphones for 4 weeks post-quit. A three-stage modeling process utilized Cox proportional hazards regression to examine time to lapse a function of 31 predictors. First, univariate models evaluated the relationship between each predictor and time to lapse. Second, the elastic net machine learning algorithm was used to select the best predictors. Third, backwards elimination further reduced the set of predictors to optimize parsimony. Results: Univariate models identified seven predictors significantly related to time to lapse. The elastic net al­ gorithm retained five: perceived odds of smoking today, confidence in ability to avoid smoking, motivation to avoid smoking, urge to smoke, and cigarette availability. The reduced model demonstrated inadequate approximation to the non-penalized baseline model. Conclusions: Accurate estimation of moments of high risk for smoking lapse remains an important goal in the development of JITAI. These results demonstrate the utility of exploratory data-driven approaches to variable selection. The results of this study can inform future JITAI by highlighting targets for intervention.},

The study group consisted of 33 male alcohol-dependent persons, who participated in a treatment program. Clinical ratings were performed three times a week by a trained person during a visit to the clinic. The questionnaire contained 23 different items about irritation, craving for alcohol. sleep disturbances, etc. The relapses were either self-reported or detected by a biochemical marker in a urine sample that was taken daily. The most important factor for a relapse in alcohol drinking was shown to be if the patient already had had one relapse during the treatment. Other important clinical factors were the levels of irritation and autonomic disturbances. None of the variables measuring mood shifts was significant. Family conditions during childhood were the most important background variables. The predictions turned out to have a rather high specificity, but the sensitivity was lower. Half of the relapses were not predicted by an increased probability for relapse. Self-reported relapses were predictable from preceding interviews and were also less frequent compared to those detected objectively by the biochemical markers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The quality and quantity of individuals' social relationships has been linked not only to mental health but also to both morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analytic review was conducted to determine the extent to which social relationships influence risk for mortality, which aspects of social relationships are most highly predictive, and which factors may moderate the risk. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on several participant characteristics, including cause of mortality, initial health status, and pre-existing health conditions, as well as on study characteristics, including length of follow-up and type of assessment of social relationships. RESULTS: Across 148 studies (308,849 participants), the random effects weighted average effect size was OR = 1.50 (95\% CI 1.42 to 1.59), indicating a 50\% increased likelihood of survival for participants with stronger social relationships. This finding remained consistent across age, sex, initial health status, cause of death, and follow-up period. Significant differences were found across the type of social measurement evaluated (p{$<$}0.001); the association was strongest for complex measures of social integration (OR = 1.91; 95\% CI 1.63 to 2.23) and lowest for binary indicators of residential status (living alone versus with others) (OR = 1.19; 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.44). CONCLUSIONS: The influence of social relationships on risk for mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.},

To date, most studies have taken a linear approach toward predicting relapse based on risk factors. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory can be used to describe processes that are not adequately modeled using a linear approach. In particular, the authors propose that catastrophe theory, a subset of nonlinear dynamical systems theory, can be used to describe the relapse process in addictive behaviors. Two small prospective studies using 6-month follow-ups of patients with alcohol use disorders (inpatient, n=51; outpatient, n=43) illustrate how cusp catastrophe theory may be used to predict relapse. Results from these preliminary studies indicate that a cusp catastrophe model has more predictive utility than traditional linear models.},

Results—The literature review found that the number of social network members, investment of the individual in the social network, levels of general and alcohol-specific support available within the social network, and specific behaviors of network members all predict drinking outcomes. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these social variables influence outcomes. The authors postulate that social variables influence outcomes by affecting intraindividual factors central to the reformulated relapse prevention model, including processes (e.g. self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation, negative affective states) and behaviors (e.g. coping and substance use. The authors suggest specific hypotheses and discuss methods that can be used to study the impact of social factors on the intraindividual phenomena that contribute to relapse.

  abstract = {Background: Social anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent and burdensome condition. Persons with social anxiety frequently avoid seeking physician support and rarely receive treatment. Social anxiety symptoms are frequently underreported and underrecognized, creating a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms. Consequently, more research is needed to identify passive biomarkers of social anxiety symptom severity. Digital phenotyping, the use of passive sensor data to inform health care decisions, offers a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier. Objective: This study aims to determine whether passive sensor data acquired from smartphone data can accurately predict social anxiety symptom severity using a publicly available dataset. Methods: In this study, participants (n=59) completed self-report assessments of their social anxiety symptom severity, depressive symptom severity, positive affect, and negative affect. Next, participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their movement (accelerometers) and social contact (incoming and outgoing calls and texts) over 2 weeks. Afterward, these passive sensor data were used to form digital biomarkers, which were paired with machine learning models to predict participants’ social anxiety symptom severity. Results: The results suggested that these passive sensor data could be utilized to accurately predict participants’ social anxiety symptom severity (r=0.702 between predicted and observed symptom severity) and demonstrated discriminant validity between depression, negative affect, and positive affect. Conclusions: These results suggest that smartphone sensor data may be utilized to accurately detect social anxiety symptom severity and discriminate social anxiety symptom severity from depressive symptoms, negative affect, and positive affect.},

  abstract = {Objective—Many individuals entering treatment are involved in social networks and activities that heighten relapse risk. Consequently, treatment programs facilitate engagement in social recovery resources, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), to provide a low risk network. While it is assumed that AA works partially through this social mechanism, research has been limited in rigor and scope. This study used lagged mediational methods to examine changes in pro-abstinent and pro-drinking network ties and activities. Method—Adults (N = 1,726) participating in a randomized controlled trial of alcohol use disorder treatment were assessed at intake, and 3, 9, and 15 months. Generalized linear modeling (GLM) tested whether changes in pro-abstinent and pro-drinking network ties and drinking and abstinent activities helped explain AA's effects. Results—Greater AA attendance facilitated substantial decreases in pro-drinking social ties and significant, but less substantial increases in pro-abstinent ties. Also, AA attendance reduced engagement in drinking-related activities and increased engagement in abstinent activities. Lagged mediational analyses revealed that it was through reductions in pro-drinking network ties and, to a lesser degree, increases in pro-abstinent ties that AA exerted its salutary effect on abstinence, and to a lesser extent, on drinking intensity. Conclusions—AA appears to facilitate recovery by mobilizing adaptive changes in the social networks of individuals exhibiting a broad range of impairment. Specifically by reducing involvement with pro-drinking ties and increasing involvement with pro-abstinent ties. These changes may aid recovery by decreasing exposure to alcohol-related cues thereby reducing craving, while simultaneously increasing rewarding social relationships.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) seek and provide support for relapse prevention in text-based online environments such as discussion forums. This paper investigates whether language use within a peer-to-peer discussion forum can predict future relapse among individuals treated for AUD. A total of 104 AUD sufferers who had completed residential treatment participated in a mobile phone-based relapse-prevention program, where they communicated via an online forum over the course of a year. We extracted patterns of language use on the forum within the first four months on study using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a dictionary-based text analysis program. Participants reported their incidence of risky drinking via a survey at 4, 8, and 12 months. A logistic regression model was built to predict the likelihood that individuals would engage in risky drinking within a year based on their language use, while controlling for baseline characteristics and rates of utilizing the mobile system. Results show that all baseline characteristics and system use factors explained just 13\% of the variance in relapse, whereas a small number of linguistic cues, including swearing and cognitive mechanism words, accounted for an additional 32\% of the total 45\% of variance in relapse explained by the model. Effective models for predicting relapse are needed. Messages exchanged on AUD forums could provide an unobtrusive and cost-effective window into the future health outcomes of AUD sufferers, and their psychological underpinnings. As online communication expands, models that leverage user-submitted text toward predicting relapse will be increasingly scalable and actionable.},

  abstract = {Mental well-being and social media have been closely related domains of study. In this research a novel model, AD prediction model, for anxious depression prediction in real-time tweets is proposed. This mixed anxiety-depressive disorder is a predominantly associated with erratic thought process, restlessness and sleeplessness. Based on the linguistic cues and user posting patterns, the feature set is defined using a 5-tuple vector {$<$}word, timing, frequency, sentiment, contrast{$>$}. An anxiety-related lexicon is built to detect the presence of anxiety indicators. Time and frequency of tweet is analyzed for irregularities and opinion polarity analytics is done to find inconsistencies in posting behaviour. The model is trained using three classifiers (multinomial na\textbackslash "ive bayes, gradient boosting, and random forest) and majority voting using an ensemble voting classifier is done. Preliminary results are evaluated for tweets of sampled 100 users and the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 85.09\%.},

The RP model proposed by Marlatt and Gordon suggests that both immediate determinants (e.g., high-risk situations, coping skills, outcome expectancies, and the abstinence violation effect) and covert antecedents (e.g., lifestyle factors and urges and cravings) can contribute to relapse. The RP model also incorporates numerous specific and global intervention strategies that allow therapist and client to address each step of the relapse process. Specific interventions include identifying specific high-risk situations for each client and enhancing the client’s skills for coping with those situations, increasing the client’s self-efficacy, eliminating myths regarding alcohol’s effects, managing lapses, and restructuring the client’s perceptions of the relapse process. Global strategies comprise balancing the client’s lifestyle and helping him or her develop positive addictions, employing stimulus control techniques and urge-management techniques, and developing relapse road maps. Several studies have provided theoretical and practical support for the RP model.},

  abstract = {Background:Addictive disorders and substance use are significant health challenges worldwide, and relapse is a core component of addictive disorders. The dynamics surrounding relapse and especially the immediate period before it occurs is only partly understood, much due to difficulties collecting reliable and sufficient data from this narrow period. Mobile sensing has been an important way to improve data quality and enhance predictive capabilities for symptom worsening within physical and mental health care, but is less developed within substance use research.Methodology:This scoping review aimed to reviewing the currently available research on mobile sensing of substance use and relapse in substance use disorders. The search was conducted in January 2019 using PubMed and Web of Science.Results:Six articles were identified, all concerning subjects using alcohol. In the studies a range of mobile sensors and derived aggregated features were employed. Data collected through mobile sensing were predominantly used to make dichotomous inference on ongoing substance use or not and in some cases on the quantity of substance intake. Only one of the identified studies predicted later substance use. A range of statistical machine learning techniques was employed.Conclusions:The research on mobile sensing in this field remains scarce. The issues requiring further attention include more research on clinical populations in naturalistic settings, use of a priori knowledge in statistical modeling, focus on prediction of substance use rather than purely identification, and finally research on other substances than alcohol.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the on-line recommendation problem facing new users and new items; we assume that no information is available neither about users, nor about the items. The only source of information is a set of ratings given by users to some items. By on-line, we mean that the set of users, and the set of items, and the set of ratings is evolving along time and that at any moment, the recommendation system has to select items to recommend based on the currently available information, that is basically the sequence of past events. We also mean that each user comes with her preferences which may evolve along short and longer scales of time; so we have to continuously update their preferences. When the set of ratings is the only available source of information, the traditional approach is matrix factorization. In a decision making under uncertainty setting, actions should be selected to balance exploration with exploitation; this is best modeled as a bandit problem. Matrix factors provide a latent representation of users and items. These representations may then be used as contextual information by the bandit algorithm to select items. This last point is exactly the originality of this paper: the combination of matrix factorization and bandit algorithms to solve the on-line recommendation problem. Our work is driven by considering the recommendation problem as a feedback controlled loop. This leads to interactions between the representation learning, and the recommendation policy.},

Little is known, however, about specific factors that may influence the use of these technologies among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations with SUDs. This study characterized the use of digital technologies and the Internet among individuals receiving treatment for opioid use disorder, focusing on identifying predictors of Internet use for health-related purposes. Participants came from an urban opioid replacement therapy program and completed a face-to-face survey on Internet and technology use. We examined the association between online health information seeking and technology acceptance variables, including perceived usefulness, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions (e.g., availability of devices/services and technical support). Participants (N = 178, ages 18–64) endorsed high rates of current smartphone ownership (94\%) and everyday Internet use (67\%). 88\% of participants reported searching online for information about health or medical topics in the past 3 months. Predictors of Internet use for health-related purposes were higher technology acceptance for mobile Internet use, younger age, current employment, and less bodily pain. Our results demonstrate high acceptance and use of mobile technology and the Internet among this sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with SUDs. However, these findings also highlight the importance of identifying barriers that disadvantaged groups face in using mobile technologies when designing technologybased interventions for this population.},

Identification of at-risk individuals with schizophrenia is challenging when they do not seek treatment. Microblogging platforms allow users to share their thoughts and emotions with the world in short snippets of text. In this work, we leveraged the large corpus of Twitter posts and machine-learning methodologies to detect individuals with schizophrenia. Using features from tweets such as emoticon use, posting time of day, and dictionary terms, we trained, built, and validated several machine learning models. Our support vector machine model achieved the best performance with 92\% precision and 71\% recall on the held-out test set. Additionally, we built a web application that dynamically displays summary statistics between cohorts. This enables outreach to undiagnosed individuals, improved physician diagnoses, and destigmatization of schizophrenia.},

METHOD: Findings from seven large multisite studies were combined to derive estimates of the average effectiveness of alcoholism treatment. To provide common outcome measures, conversion equations were used to compute variables not reported in the original studies. RESULTS: During the year after treatment, 1 in 4 clients remained continuously abstinent on average, and an additional 1 in 10 used alcohol moderately and without problems. During this period, mortality averaged less than 2\%. The remaining clients, as a group, showed substantial improvement, abstaining on 3 days out of 4 and reducing their overall alcohol consumption by 87\%, on average. Alcohol-related problems also decreased by 60\%. CONCLUSIONS: About one third of clients remain asymptomatic during the year following a single treatment event. The remaining two thirds show, on average, large and significant decreases in drinking and related problems. This substantial level of improvement in "unremitted" clients tends to be overlooked when outcomes are dichotomized as successful or relapsed.},

We provide a layered, hierarchical model for translating raw sensor data into markers of behaviors and states related to mental health. Also discussed are research methods as well as challenges, including privacy and problems of dimensionality. Although personal sensing is still in its infancy, it holds great promise as a method for conducting mental health research and as a clinical tool for monitoring at-risk populations and providing the foundation for the next generation of mobile health (or mHealth) interventions.},

We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

Methods: Anonymized geographic location recordings from 22 BD participants and 14 healthy controls (HC) were collected over 3 months. Participants reported their depressive symptomatology using a weekly questionnaire (QIDS-SR16). Recorded location data were preprocessed by detecting and removing imprecise data points and features were extracted to assess the level and regularity of geographic movements of the participant. A subset of features were selected using a wrapper feature selection method and presented to 1) a linear regression model and a quadratic generalized linear model with a logistic link function for questionnaire score estimation; and 2) a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier for depression detection in BD participants based on their questionnaire responses. R esults: HC participants did not report depressive symptoms and their features showed similar distributions to nondepressed BD participants. Questionnaire score estimation using geolocation-derived features from BD participants demonstrated an optimal mean absolute error rate of 3.73, while depression detection demonstrated an optimal (median ± IQR) [Formula: see text] score of 0.857 ± 0.022 using five features (classification accuracy: 0.849 ± 0.016; sensitivity: 0.839 ± 0.014; specificity: 0.872 ± 0.047). Conclusion: These results demonstrate a strong link between geographic movements and depression in bipolar disorder. S ignificance: To our knowledge, this is the first community study of passively recorded objective markers of depression in bipolar disorder of this scale. The techniques could help individuals monitor their depression and enable healthcare providers to detect those in need of care or treatment.},

The MPQ thus holds considerable potential as a structural framework for investigating personality across varying levels of analysis, and this potential would be enhanced by the availability of an abbreviated version. This article describes efforts to develop and validate a brief (155-item) form, the MPQ-BF. Success was evidenced by uniformly high correlations between the brief- and full-form trait scales and consistency of higher order structures. The MPQ-BF is recommended as a tool for investigating the genetic, neurobiological, and psychological substrates of personality.},

  abstract = {Depression is currently the second most significant contributor to non-fatal disease burdens globally. While it is treatable, depression remains undiagnosed in many cases. As mobile phones have now become an integral part of daily life, this study examines the possibility of screening for depressive symptoms continuously based on patients’ mobile usage patterns.412 research participants reported a range of their mobile usage statistics. Beck Depression Inventory—2nd ed (BDI-II) was used to measure the severity of depression among participants. A wide array of machine learning classification algorithms was trained to detect participants with depression symptoms (ie, BDI-II score ≥ 14). The relative importance of individual variables was additionally quantified.Participants with depression were found to have fewer saved contacts on their devices, spend more time on their mobile devices to make and receive fewer and shorter calls, and send more text messages than participants without depression. The best model was a random forest classifier, which had an out-of-sample balanced accuracy of 0.768. The balanced accuracy increased to 0.811 when participants’ age and gender were included.The significant predictive power of mobile usage attributes implies that, by collecting mobile usage statistics, mental health mobile applications can continuously screen for depressive symptoms for initial diagnosis or for monitoring the progress of ongoing treatments. Moreover, the input variables used in this study were aggregated mobile usage metadata attributes, which has low privacy sensitivity making it more likely for patients to grant required application permissions.},

Statistical features were computationally extracted from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color analysis, metadata components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models outperformed general practitioners’ average unassisted diagnostic success rate for depression. These results held even when the analysis was restricted to posts made before depressed individuals were first diagnosed. Human ratings of photo attributes (happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of depression, and were uncorrelated with computationally-generated features. These results suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental illness.},

  abstract = {Alcohol consumption, particularly heavier drinking, is an important risk factor for many health problems and, thus, is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. In fact, alcohol is a necessary underlying cause for more than 30 conditions and a contributing factor to many more. The most common disease categories that are entirely or partly caused by alcohol consumption include infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes, neuropsychiatric diseases (including alcohol use disorders), cardiovascular disease, liver and pancreas disease, and unintentional and intentional injury. Knowledge of these disease risks has helped in the development of low-risk drinking guidelines. In addition to these disease risks that affect the drinker, alcohol consumption also can affect the health of others and cause social harm both to the drinker and to others, adding to the overall cost associated with alcohol consumption. These findings underscore the need to develop effective prevention efforts to reduce the pain and suffering, and the associated costs, resulting from excessive alcohol use.},

  abstract = {This study examines relapse and recovery in Project MATCH. The study examines the transitions between periods of abstinence, lapse, and relapse. A set of proximal and distal variables were hypothesized to predict the likelihood of a transition to a different state over time using a semi-Markov model. The distal variables were stable predictors of relapse including severity of addiction, drug use, and psychiatric severity. The proximal predictors, which varied over time, included anger, symptoms of depression, action, struggling with maintenance, temptation, confidence, and social support. The study examined drinking outcomes of 469 individuals post-treatment and found that confidence to abstain and action orientation increased the probability of abstinence, and decreased the probability of lapsed and relapsed drinking. Confidence and endorsing action stage behaviors and attitudes were associated with the abstinence violation effect. The constructs of temptation and struggling with maintenance acted as risk factors for higher levels of drinking. Depression had mixed effects and appeared to be related to lapsed drinking more than relapsed drinking. Alcohol involvement acted as a risk factor for relapsed drinking. Information about the individuals drinking history was also examined. The number of prior episodes in abstinence or drinking states increased the probability of returning to the same types of abstinent or drinking behaviors. The length of each episode less frequently was significantly related to the transitions, However when significant, longer periods of abstinence and relapsed drinking were associated with less likely return to the same behaviors. Of particular note was that a history of relapsed drinking made lapsed drinking less likely, and a history of lapsed drinking made relapsed drinking less likely. This pattern supports the underlying division of drinking behaviors into the two categories of lapse and relapse. This study demonstrated that novel statistical methods such as Semi-Markov models can be used to investigate questions which could not be addressed or effectively answered with more commonly used methods. The semi-Markov models of transitions between drinking states helped to explain the complexity of the road to recovery.},

  abstract = {Background: Is someone at home, at their friend’s place, at a restaurant, or enjoying the outdoors? Knowing the semantic location of an individual matters for delivering medical interventions, recommendations, and other context-aware services. This knowledge is particularly useful in mental health care for monitoring relevant behavioral indicators to improve treatment delivery. Local search-and-discovery services such as Foursquare can be used to detect semantic locations based on the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates, but GPS alone is often inaccurate. Mobile phones can also sense other signals (such as movement, light, and sound), and the use of these signals promises to lead to a better estimation of an individual’s semantic location. Objective: We aimed to examine the ability of mobile phone sensors to estimate semantic locations, and to evaluate the relationship between semantic location visit patterns and depression and anxiety. Methods: A total of 208 participants across the United States were asked to log the type of locations they visited daily, using their mobile phones for a period of 6 weeks, while their phone sensor data was recorded. Using the sensor data and Foursquare queries based on GPS coordinates, we trained models to predict these logged locations, and evaluated their prediction accuracy on participants that models had not seen during training. We also evaluated the relationship between the amount of time spent in each semantic location and depression and anxiety assessed at baseline, in the middle, and at the end of the study. Results: While Foursquare queries detected true semantic locations with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.62, using phone sensor data alone increased the AUC to 0.84. When we used Foursquare and sensor data together, the AUC further increased to 0.88. We found some significant relationships between the time spent in certain locations and depression and anxiety, although these relationships were not consistent. Conclusions: The accuracy of location services such as Foursquare can significantly benefit from using phone sensor data. However, our results suggest that the nature of the places people visit explains only a small part of the variation in their anxiety and depression symptoms.},

We present an overview of empirical results on the multi-scale dynamics of social dynamics and networks inferred from mobile telephone calls. We begin with the shortest timescales and fastest dynamics, such as burstiness of call sequences between individuals, and “zoom out” towards longer temporal and larger structural scales, from temporal motifs formed by correlated calls between multiple individuals to long-term dynamics of social groups.

  abstract = {For many individuals, substance use leads to a chronic cycle of relapse, treatment reentry, and recovery, often lasting for decades. This study replicates earlier work, documents the transition patterns within the cycle during a 3-year period, and identifies variables that predict these transitions. Data are from 1,326 adults recruited from sequential admissions to 12 substance abuse treatment facilities in Chicago, IL, between 1996 and 1998. Participants were predominantly female (60\%) and African American (88\%) adults. Participants were interviewed at intake, and at 6, 24, and 36 months post-intake follow-up rates ranged from 94\% to 98\% per wave. At each observation, participants' current status in the cycle was classified as (1) in the community using, (2) incarcerated, (3) in treatment, or (4) in the community not using. The transitional probabilities and correlates of pathways between these states were estimated. Over 83\% of the participants transitioned from one point in the cycle to another during the 3 years (including 36\% two times, 14\% three times). For the people in the community, about half remained in the same status (either using or abstinent) and just under half transitioned. The majority of people whose beginning status was incarceration or in-treatment also transitioned by the end of the observation period. While there was some overlap, predictors typically varied by pathway and direction (e.g., using to not using vs. not using to using). These results help demonstrate the need to adopt a chronic vs. acute care model for substance use. While exploratory and observational, several of the predictors are time-dependent and identify promising targets for interventions designed to shorten the cycle and increase the long-term effectiveness of treatment.},

  abstract = {Social systems are in a constant state of flux, with dynamics spanning from minute-by-minute changes to patterns present on the timescale of years. Accurate models of social dynamics are important for understanding the spreading of influence or diseases, formation of friendships, and the productivity of teams. Although there has been much progress on understanding complex networks over the past decade, little is known about the regularities governing the microdynamics of social networks. Here, we explore the dynamic social network of a densely-connected population of ∼1,000 individuals and their interactions in the network of real-world person-to-person proximity measured via Bluetooth, as well as their telecommunication networks, online social media contacts, geolocation, and demographic data. These high-resolution data allow us to observe social groups directly, rendering community detection unnecessary. Starting from 5-min time slices, we uncover dynamic social structures expressed on multiple timescales. On the hourly timescale, we find that gatherings are fluid, with members coming and going, but organized via a stable core of individuals. Each core represents a social context. Cores exhibit a pattern of recurring meetings across weeks and months, each with varying degrees of regularity. Taken together, these findings provide a powerful simplification of the social network, where cores represent fundamental structures expressed with strong temporal and spatial regularity. Using this framework, we explore the complex interplay between social and geospatial behavior, documenting how the formation of cores is preceded by coordination behavior in the communication networks and demonstrating that social behavior can be predicted with high precision.},

However, within the lapse day itself, NA was already significantly increasing hours before lapses, but only for episodes attributed to stress or bad mood. Thus, rapid increases in NA, but not slow-changing shifts in stress and NA, were associated with relapse.},

Stanton notes that the recent reconceptualization of relapse prevention by Witkiewitz and Marlatt enhances the model by 'synthesizing recent empirical findings into a unified theory', but it does not go far enough. The new model reviews research evidence to support a multidimensional, dynamic, and systemic understanding of relapse. It incorporates concepts from systems theory (e.g., self-organization, reciprocity, feedback loops) to explain the complex interaction of factors involved in lapse and relapse episodes. These changes in the model provide greater sensitivity to the experiences of individuals across categories of drug type and high-risk situation, and they allow for significant variations in the core determinants of relapse. However, the role of interpersonal determinants receives scant attention in the article and in the new model. While it is a significant improvement over the static, linear model it replaces. Its value would be further enhanced by inclusion of concurrent social support as a phasic response that interacts with coping behavior and affective state, in addition to its role as a distal risk. Concurrent social support can play a significant role in the midst of high-risk situations. Including it in the phasic circle in the model is consistent with evidence-based clinical practice, and it may ensure that social support is not overlooked in future research into the relapse process.

Research has increasingly focused on how the basic dimensions of anxiety sensitivity are related to various forms of psychopathology.

Subsequently developed multidimensional measures have unstable factor structures or measure only a subset of the most widely replicated factors. Therefore, the authors developed, via factor analysis of responses from U.S. and Canadian nonclinical participants (n ⬚ 2,361), an 18-item measure, the ASI–3, which assesses the 3 factors best replicated in previous research: Physical, Cognitive, and Social Concerns. Factorial validity of the ASI–3 was supported by confirmatory factor analyses of 6 replication samples, including nonclinical samples from the United States and Canada, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Spain (n ⬚ 4,494) and a clinical sample from the United States and Canada (n ⬚ 390). The ASI–3 displayed generally good performance on other indices of reliability and validity, along with evidence of improved psychometric properties over the original ASI.},

  abstract = {Recent innovations in alcohol-focused interventions are aimed at closing the gap between population need and the currently uncommon use of alcohol treatment services. Guided by population data showing the heterogeneity of alcohol problems and the occurrence of natural remissions from problem drinking without treatment, alcohol services have begun to expand beyond clinical treatment to offer the untreated majority of individuals with alcohol-related problems accessible, less-intensive services that use the tools of public health practice. These services often are opportunistic, meaning they can be provided in primary-care or other unspecialized health care or community settings. They also can be delivered by nonspecialists, or can be used by people themselves to address problems with alcohol without entering the health care system. This developing spectrum of services includes screening and brief interventions, guided self-change programs, and telehealth options that often are targeted and tailored for high-risk groups (e.g., college drinkers). Other efforts aimed at reducing barriers to care and increasing motivation to seek help have utilized individual, organizational, and public health strategies. Together, these efforts have potential for helping the treatment field reach people who have realized that they have a drinking problem but have not yet experienced the severe negative consequences that may eventually drive them to seek treatment. Although the evidence supporting several innovations in alcohol services is preliminary, some approaches are well established, and collectively they form an emerging continuum of care for alcohol problems aimed at increasing service availability and improving overall impact on population health.},

  abstract = {Background: As smartphone has been widely used, understanding how depression correlates with social behavior on smartphones can be beneficial for early diagnosis of depression. An enormous amount of research relied on self-report questionnaires, which is not objective. Only recently the increased availability of rich data about human behavior in digital space has provided new perspectives for the investigation of individual differences. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore depressed Chinese individuals’ social behavior in digital space through metadata collected via smartphones. Methods: A total of 120 participants were recruited to carry a smartphone with a metadata collection app (MobileSens). At the end of metadata collection, they were instructed to complete the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). We then separated participants into nondepressed and depressed groups based on their scores on CES-D. From the metadata of smartphone usage, we extracted 44 features, including traditional social behaviors such as making calls and sending SMS text messages, and the usage of social apps (eg, WeChat and Sina Weibo, 2 popular social apps in China). The 2-way ANOVA (nondepressed vs depressed × male vs female) and multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to investigate differences in social behaviors on smartphones among users. Results: The results found depressed users received less calls from contacts (all day: F1,116=3.995, P=.048, η2=0.033; afternoon: F1,116=5.278, P=.02, η2=0.044), and used social apps more frequently (all day: F1,116=6.801, P=.01, η2=0.055; evening: F1,116=6.902, P=.01, η2=0.056) than nondepressed ones. In the depressed group, females used Weibo more frequently than males (all day: F1,116=11.744, P=.001, η2=0.092; morning: F1,116=9.105, P=.003, η2=0.073; afternoon: F1,116=14.224, P\&lt;.001, η2=0.109; evening: F1,116=9.052, P=.003, η2=0.072). Moreover, usage of social apps in the evening emerged as a predictor of depressive symptoms for all participants (odds ratio [OR] 1.007, 95\% CI 1.001-1.013; P=.02) and male (OR 1.013, 95\% CI 1.003-1.022; P=.01), and usage of Weibo in the morning emerged as a predictor for female (OR 1.183, 95\% CI 1.015-1.378; P=.03). Conclusions: This paper finds that there exists a certain correlation between depression and social behavior on smartphones. The result may be useful to improve social interaction for depressed individuals in the daily lives and may be insightful for early diagnosis of depression.},

In the current study, discretetime survival analysis and latent growth mixture modeling were used to evaluate the time to first lapse and the trajectories of postlapse drinking in a sample of 563 individuals who received community alcohol treatment. Results showed a decreasing risk of lapsing over time. After the initial lapse, 3 trajectory subgroups provided a parsimonious representation of the heterogeneity in postlapse drinking frequency and quantity, with the majority of individuals reporting light, infrequent drinking. Covariate analyses incorporating demographics, distal risk factors, time to first lapse, and coping behavior as predictors of time to lapse and postlapse drinking trajectories indicated that alcohol dependence and coping behavior were the strongest predictors of lapsing and postlapse drinking behavior.},

Alan Marlatt (see record [rid]2004-14303-002[/rid]). In the current comment the authors of the original article respond to Stanton. Witkiewitz and Marlatt acknowledge that Stanton's comment is an important and thoughtful extension of the dynamic model of relapse they originally proposed. Stanton reviewed empirical research on the proximal role of social support in lapse events and provided a careful consideration of why interpersonal dynamics may serve as phasic processes within high-risk situations for relapse. Clearly the data provide support for an emphasis on interpersonal precipitants in the model. It is important to note that the relationship between interpersonal factors and treatment outcomes is not straightforward. The authors agree with Stanton that the dynamic relationship between interpersonal factors and relapse is an important area of future research. In general, the dynamic model of relapse that they proposed should be treated as an empirical question, and they encourage more critical thinking about, and revision of, the model. The field may benefit greatly by returning to the study of individual differences, systemic relapse processes, and the individual dynamics of treatment failure, as well as the protective factors that are predictive of treatment success.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated transitions between drinking and nondrinking during the first 12 months following treatment and whether transitions in posttreatment drinking are related to alcohol-dependence symptoms. METHOD: Data from individuals in the outpatient (n = 952) and aftercare (n = 774) arms of Project MATCH (Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity) were included in the analyses. Drinking consequences, percentage of drinking days, and drinks per drinking day were used as indicators of drinking behavior. Latent transition analysis was used to estimate a model of drinking patterns, defined by transition probabilities between drinking classes, from immediately following treatment to 6 and 12 months following treatment. RESULTS: Across both aftercare and outpatient samples, three drinking classes were identified at each time point: frequent heavy drinking with high consequences, moderate infrequent drinking with low consequences, and nondrinking with low consequences. Many participants maintained nondrinking, and, of those who drank, there was a trend toward transitioning to less drinking over time. Transition probabilities were noninvariant across treatment arms: The probability of transitioning from moderate drinking to frequent drinking was more than six times more likely in the aftercare arm, as compared with the outpatient arm. In both samples the transition to heavy drinking and membership in the heavy-drinking class were significantly positively related to alcohol dependence symptoms. There were no differences across MATCH treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study examined transitions in post treatment drinking and the role of alcohol dependence in predicting posttreatment drinking. The results suggest a low probability of moderate drinking among individuals with greater alcohol dependence.},

  abstract = {Alcohol dependence has been described as a relapsing condition and it has been proposed that alcohol lapses could potentially be explained by dynamic associations between contextual, interpersonal, and intrapersonal risk factors. Yet, few studies have tested the associations between risk factors in the prediction of lapse dynamics. The current study was a secondary analysis of data from the COMBINE study (n = 1,383; COMBINE Study Research Group, 2003). The goal of the current study was to examine static (alcohol dependence severity, treatment history, marital status, psychiatric symptoms) and dynamic (negative affect, craving, stress) predictors of heavy drinking during the course of treatment and up to one year following treatment. Results from dynamic latent difference score models indicated that higher levels of static and dynamic risk and increased dynamic risk over time were significantly associated with greater increases in heavy drinking. Likewise, more frequent heavy drinking and higher static risk predicted higher levels of dynamic risk. In addition, changes in dynamic risk factors significantly mediated the association between changes in heavy drinking and both psychiatric symptoms and treatment history. It is important to note that while the effects of static and dynamic risk factors in the prediction of heavy drinking were statistically significant, the magnitude of the effects were small. The current study provided partial support for a dynamic model of relapse; however future research using intensive longitudinal data collection and more advanced statistical techniques could further elucidate lapse dynamics and potentially improve relapse prevention planning.},

Borderline personality disorder combines interpersonal, affective, and behavioral regulation impairments making it particularly ill-suited to a “one size fits all” diagnosis. Clinical assessment and case formulation involve understanding and developing a personalized model for each patient’s contextualized dynamic processes, and research would benefit from a similar focus on the individual. Method: We use group iterative multiple model estimation, which estimates a model for each individual and identifies general or shared features across individuals, in both a mixed-diagnosis sample (N=78) and a subsample with a single diagnosis (n=24). Results: We found that individuals vary widely in their dynamic processes in affective and interpersonal domains both within and across diagnoses. However, there was some evidence that dynamic patterns relate to transdiagnostic baseline measures. We conclude with descriptions of two person-specific models as an example of the heterogeneity of dynamic processes. Conclusions: The idiographic models presented here join a growing literature showing that the individuals differ dramatically in the total patterning of these processes, even as key processes are shared across individuals. We argue that these processes are best estimated in the context of person-specific models, and that so doing may advance our understanding of the contextualized dynamic processes that could identify maintenance mechanisms and treatment targets.},

The goals of the present analyses were (1) to determine which of the 11 component indexes are most predictive of treatment outcome regardless of treatment type and (2) to determine which of the indexes are most influential in the already demonstrated network support by treatment interaction effect. METHOD: This is a secondary data analysis of the outpatient arm of Project MATCH (N = 952), focusing primarily on the Important People and Activities instrument administered pretreatment. RESULTS: Patients with larger daily networks and patients with more abstainers/recovering alcoholics in their networks had a better prognosis. Patients with a higher network drinking frequency did better in Twelve Step Facilitation than in Motivational Enhancement Therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Three of the 11 indexes can be used to replicate the prognostic and matching effects found for an overall index of network support. These may be measured by a short form of the Important People and Activities instrument.},
