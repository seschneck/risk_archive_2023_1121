The scripts in this folder are used to create features for the lag study.  Follow these steps

1. Edit `lead_hours` and `version` in both `mak_jobs.R` and `mak_features_chtc.R`
2. Run `mak_jobs.R` in RStudio.  This will create a new folder that contains the files needed to make features for a batch of jobs (i.e., for a specific lag).  These files are saved in an appropriately named folder on the server at `studydata/risk/chtc/lag/features/[batchname]`. There are subfolders for input and output.
3. FTP to CTHC and transfer all the files from the input folder to CHTC.
4. SSH to CHTC and run `features.sub` (`condor_submit features.sub`)
5. Monitor the jobs using `condor_q` (see docs in CHTC unit in `docs_arc`)
6. When the jobs have all completed, check that all the output is there and that there were no errors
  - INSERT info
  - INSERT info
7. FTP the combined features back to server into the output folder.  FTP the job log file back to the output folder as well.
