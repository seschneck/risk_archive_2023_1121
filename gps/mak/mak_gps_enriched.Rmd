### Code Status

Complete

### Notes   

This script aggregates gps files for all subjects and then matches each 
geolocation to its nearest context.

The sample starts with the N = 151 participants who completed through at 
least follow-up 1 and who had valid lapse data.   More details on these decisions
are available in the cleaning of EMA and lapses and in the mak_study_dates.Rmd
scripts

We then do EDA to confirm that GPS data are valid for these N=151.  
This results in further removals.  Final sample is N = 146 

**GPS problems that require removal**
All had 50% or greater missing data and no long contiguous subsets

* 190 had gps problems through-out study.  Missing GPS on most (85) days.  Drop participant [no lapses]
* 56 is missing most of their data until the last few days of the study. Drop participant [26 lapses]
* 2 had tech (samsung) issues and is missing most of their data until the last few days of the study. Drop participant [5 lapses]
* 51 tech (samsung) issues with big (month long) gaps in their data.  No continuous sections with
good data.  [14 lapses]
* 21 had tech (samsung) issues.  Large gaps.  Drop participant [no lapses]




**GPS problems that require adjustment of study dates**

* 80 has good data for about first month (through 7/31).  No data after that b/c app not on phone.  
set study end to 7/31 (lost 6 valid lapses but retains 1 lapse)
* 74 had problems with Moves.  Gaps in data using Moves.  Switched to FollowMee on 7/19 and seemed
to resolve issue.   Set study start to 7/19
* 84 had many phone issues (lost phone, missing data, out of country wiht GPS off).  But had good data through 8/6.
Set study end to 8/6 [lost 1 lapse and retained none].
* 65 had tech (samsung) issues with many gaps in gps.  Has completed data starting at 7/18.
Set study start to 7/18 [lost two lapses]
* 117 turned off location services repeatedly b/c of data plan issues. Many gaps. There is a somewhat gap free
period started at 10/14 - end of study.  Set study start to 10/14 [loses 3 but retains 7 lapses]
* 19 had tech issues (samsung) with many gaps in gps.  Mostly continuous block between
11/26 - 1/17.  Adjust study start to 11/26 and study end to 1/17 [ lost no lapses and retained 2 lapses]
* 42 had many big gaps throughout their data. Mostly continous block started at 4/11 to end of study
Set study start to 4/11.  [lost 4 but retained 14 lapses]
* 167 had gps problems in first month.  Resolved at FU1.  Recode study start to 2/6 (data of FU1 when GPS starts working)
* 207 had issues with broken phone, missing days, and out of country travel. Despite this, data were ok (some gaps but not really big ones) through 5/19.   
End study on 5/19 (lost two lapses) 
* 28 missing data for most of the first month.   Data are present afterward.  Adjust study start to 12/18
* 218 has last day GPS on 6/4.  End study on that day [lost 3 lapses]
* 39 has good data though 5/11.  End study on that day.
* 214 missing big gap (4/5 - 4/16) near start of study because of tech issue.   
Set study start to 4/17 [lost 4 lapses but has many more]
* 47 has almost no data after 4/16.  Set study end to 4/16 [lost two lapses but have many more]
* 203 missing large gap starting on 5/20.  Set study end to 5/19 
* 40 has big gap start  on 4/29.  Set study end to 4/28
* 76 has last date of GPS on 8/20.  Set study end to 8/20
* 78 has last day of GPS on 8/28.  Set study end to 8/28
* 161 has big gap from 12/10 - 12/19.  Set study start to 12/20
* 180 traveled out of country for most of first month.  Set start date to 3/2 
[lost many invalid and a couple of valid lapses. Many remain]
* 169 has five day gap at study start.  Set study start to 2/19 [lost one lapse but retained MANY more]
* 34 is missing data right near end.  Set study end to 3/1.  [Lost one valid lapse but retained MANY]
* 265 has OK data from start through 10/7.  But there is one 6 day gap. Set study end to 10/7
* 30 has good data through 12-24.   set study end to 12/24
* 63 has some big gaps Also stays home a lot.  Has a good. mostly continuous
block from study start until 6/7.  Set study end to 6/7/  [Lost 1 lapse, retained zero]
* 178 has one big gap in middle of study 2/11 - 2/25.  Data is continuous from 2/25 through 
end of study.  Set study start to 2/25.  [lost 5 but retained 2 lapses]

**Data OK despite missing; No adjustments**

* 3 has missing days but these appear to result from not leaving home for long periods do to a fractured leg.  Retain all data
* 53 has some gaps but data appear usable as is
* 134 OK.  Missing days likely due to not leaving home much.
* 185 OK.  Missing days likely due to not leaving home much.
* 26 has some gaps.  One due to being housebound and others but data seem sufficient 
once gaps are handled.
* 139 has gaps but rarely left home.  Likely OK
* 66 has a few gaps but OK
* 32 has some gaps but OK
* 27 has some missing days but OK
* 79 has some missing days but OK
* 231 has some missing days but OK
* 270 has some missing days but OK
* 191 has few day gap but OK
* 238 has one four day gap but OK
* 137 missing one five day gap but OK
* 241 has one big gap - Missing: 9/05-9/11/19.   Lapses before, during and after gap.

### Study Dates

Open study dates b/c it contains all the subids with context and valid lapses and 
start and end dates for good GPS (determied iteratively in this script)
```{r}
study_dates <- vroom(here(path_gps, "study_dates.csv"), col_types = "dTTT",
                     show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(study_start = as_date(study_start),
         study_end = as_date(study_end)) %>% 
  mutate(study_ndays = as.numeric(difftime(study_end, study_start, units = "days"))) %>% 
  glimpse()

subids_dates <- study_dates %>% 
  pull(subid) %>% 
  unique()
```

### Locations

Confirm that locations exists and has some places
```{r}
locs <- vroom(here(path_shared, "locations.csv"), col_types = "cddcccccccccccdd",
              show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(subid = as.numeric(subid)) %>% 
  glimpse()

subids_locs <- locs %>% 
  pull(subid) %>% 
  unique

if(any(!(subids_dates %in% subids_locs))) stop("Missing location for some subids")
```



### GPS
```{r}
gps <-  vroom(here(path_shared, "gps.csv"), col_types = "ddTdccccdddd",
              show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  filter(subid %in% subids_dates) %>%   # limit to sample in study_dates
  glimpse()

#get all subids
subids_gps <- gps %>% 
  pull(subid) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  print()

if(any(!(subids_dates %in% subids_gps))) stop("Missing gps for some subids")
```

Merge context into gps
```{r}
#enrich gps with context for one subid
enrich_subid <- function(a_subid, gps, locs) {
  gps <- gps %>% 
    filter(subid == a_subid)
  
  locs <- locs %>% 
    filter(subid == a_subid)
  
  enriched <- gps %>% 
    bind_cols(map2_dfr(gps$lon, gps$lat, find_nearest_context, context = locs)) 
  
  return(enriched)
}

#future_map over subids
(n_core <- parallel::detectCores(logical = FALSE))
plan(multisession, workers = n_core)

enriched <- subids_gps %>% 
  future_map_dfr(enrich_subid, gps = gps, locs = locs) %>% 
  left_join(locs, by = c("subid", "context_id")) %>% 
  select(-lat.y, -lon.y, -accuracy, -speed_kmh, -altitude_meters, -direction,
         -data_type) %>% 
  rename(lat = lat.x, lon = lon.x) %>% 
  relocate(subid)
```


###  Brief EDA

```{r}
enriched %>%  
  glimpse

enriched %>% 
  pull(subid) %>% 
  unique %>% 
  length
```

```{r}
enriched %>% 
  tabyl(subid) %>% 
  arrange(n)

enriched %>% 
  tabyl(subid) %>%
  summarize(min(n), max(n))

enriched %>% 
  tabyl(subid) %>%
  pull(n) %>% 
  hist

enriched %>% 
  tabyl(subid) %>%
  filter(n < 5000) %>% 
  pull(n) %>% 
  hist
```

Review of missing data for context

* type is missing for 110 for one location which accounts for all missing type in df
* emotion missing for one entry ofr subids 3, 6, and 48
* risk missing for an entry for subids 3, and 121.
```{r}
enriched %>% 
  summarize(across(.fns = ~sum(is.na(.)))) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

```{r}
enriched %>% tabyl(type)
enriched %>% tabyl(drank)
enriched %>% tabyl(alcohol)
enriched %>% tabyl(emotion)
enriched %>% tabyl(risk)
enriched %>% tabyl(avoid)
enriched %>% tabyl(vacation)
```

### EDA for participant removal based on missing days

```{r}
enriched <- enriched %>% 
  mutate(time = with_tz(time, tzone = "America/Chicago")) %>% 
  mutate(gps_date = as_date(time)) %>%
  left_join(select(study_dates, subid, study_start, study_end, study_ndays), by = "subid") %>% 
  filter(gps_date >= study_start,
         gps_date <= study_end) %>% 
  glimpse()


# number of days with gps points
enriched %>% 
  group_by(subid, gps_date) %>% 
  summarize(n()) %>% 
  group_by(subid) %>% 
  summarize(gps_ndays = n()) %>% 
  left_join(select(study_dates, subid, study_ndays), by = "subid") %>% 
  mutate(days_diff = gps_ndays - study_ndays) %>% 
  arrange(days_diff) %>% 
  print(n = Inf) %>% 
  pull(days_diff) %>% 
  hist(main = "Days of Missing GPS")
```
